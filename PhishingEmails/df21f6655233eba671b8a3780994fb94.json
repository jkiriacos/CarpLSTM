This\nbalance is suspended in the escrow accounts awaiting\nclaims by any foreign company of our choice.We intend\nto pay out this fund NOW as the organisation is\nwinding up its activities since the aim of returning\nPEACE to the countries and the coast has been\nachieved.\n\nBased on the laws and ethics of employment,we as civil\nservants working under this organisation, are not\nallowed to operate a foreign account.This is the more\nreason why we needed your assistance to provide an\naccount that can sustain this fund for safe keeping\nand our future investment with your comprehensive\nadvise,assistance and partnership in your country.\n\nIt is however agreed,as the account owner in this deal\nto allow you 30% of the entire sum as compensation,\n65% will be held on trust for us while 5% will be used\nto defray any incidental charges and cost during the\ncourse of the transaction.\n\nThis transaction will be successfully concluded within\n10 days if you accord us your unalloyed and due\ncooperation if you should provide the following: \n\nYOUR COMPANY`S NAME WITH COMPLETE ADDRESS,TEL\nAND FAX NUMBERS.(if available)\n\nYOUR COMPLETE MAILING ADRRESS WITH TELEPHONE AND FAX\nNUMBERS.\n\nYOUR COMPLETE BANK PARTICULARS;NAME,ADDRESS,ACCOUNT\nNO,SWIFT CODE,TEL/FAX NOS ETC..\n\n\nUpon the receipt of this informations,the documents\nand approval with the texts will be sent to you for\nconfirmaton and then forwarded to the organisation for\nratification and subsequent payment.\n\nAs with the case of all organised (sensitive)and\nconspired DEALS,we solicit for your unreserved\nconfidentiality and utmost secret in this business. We\nhope to retire peacefully and lead a honourable\nbusiness life afterwards.There are no risks involved. \n\nI await your urgent response.\n\nYours faithfully,\nDr.Robinson Dike.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "df21f6655233eba671b8a3780994fb94"}
