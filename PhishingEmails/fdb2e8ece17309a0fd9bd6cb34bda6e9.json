I am\ninterested in doing business with your humble self,\nbut before I proceed further, I want you to please\nnote that this is not a sort of joke, I mean business.\n\nI want to invest heavily in your country and other\ncountries within your geographical zone as you may\nindicate as ideal. Once you are interested in this\nproposed joint venture transaction, I will be giving\nyou a breakdown; we will start relating with each.\n\nAs you may wish to know, I am the director of P.P.M.C\n(Petroleum Products Marketing Company); a subsidiary\nof Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,CC N.N.P.C.\nMy office is in charge of selling crude oil to foreign\ncompanies/countries that come to lift or buy oil as\nwell as registering and certifying each and every one\nof them before a single barrel is lifted. \n\nAs a result of the recent upsurge in the price of\ncrude oil, I and some of my colleague make 30 cent on\na barrel and for over the period of 2 months, we had\nrealized US$50 M (FIFTY MILLION US DOLLARS). As civil\nservants getting this money out of my country\n(Nigeria) for investment poses a problem, following\nthe fact that Government officials are prohibited from\nrunning a foreign account, and as such, I crave your\nindulgence to assist in this regard, if you wish to\nassist, kindly mail me back. So we could go in to\nbusiness. Please Email me your response to my personal box:\n\n(drgodianokocha@myway.com) \n\nAs the transaction progress, you stand the chance to\nnegotiate what your cut will be from the US$50 M\n(FIFTY MILLION US DOLLARS).\n\nI further assure you that this is a risk-free\nbusiness, Thank you for anticipated cooperation. \n\nI shall be expecting your response.\n\nI remain\nYours truly\nDr Godian Okocha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "fdb2e8ece17309a0fd9bd6cb34bda6e9"}
