During my husband's regime as Minister \nfor Interior, I realized some reasonable amount of money from various \ndeals that I successfully executed. I have plans to invest this money \nfor my children's future on real estate and industrial production. My \nhusband is not aware of this because I wish to do it secretly for \nnow. \n\nBefore the US invaded our nation, I secretly siphoned the sum of \n$12,000,000 million USD out of Iraq and deposited the money with a \nsecurity firm that transports valuable goods and consignments through \ndiplomatic means. I also declared that the consignment was solid gold \nbelonging to my foreign business partner. I am contacting you because \nI want you to go to the security company and claim the money on my \nbehalf since I have declared that the consignment belong to my \nforeign business partner. You shall also be required to assist me in \ninvestment in your country. \n\nI trust you as a reliable person who will not sit on this money when \nyou claim it, rather assist me properly I expect you to declare what \npercentage of the total money you will take for your assistance. when \nI receive your positve response I will give you all the necessary \ninformations to enable you proceed to the security company and claim \nthe money. I shall also let you know where the security company is \nand the consignment pin code to claim the consignment, which is very \nimportant. I assure you 100% safety and success once you follow my \ninstructions.\n\nFor now, let all our communication be by e-mail because my line are \ntight now connected to the US Forces Telecomunication Network \nservices.
