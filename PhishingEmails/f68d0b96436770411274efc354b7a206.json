Smith, deputy senior regional manager at Lloyds TSB \nCommercial Finance in Yorkshire. I have urgent and very confidential \nbusiness proposition for you. \nOn June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit \nfor forty-eight months, (being four years) valued at US$40,000,000.00, \n(forty Million, Dollars) in my branch.\nUpon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address \nbut got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we \ndiscovered from his employers, that Mr. Barry Kelly died from tsunami \non his holidays in Thailand 26 December 2004. On further \ninvestigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all \nattempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry \nKelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official \ndocuments, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum \nof US$40,000,000 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security \ncompany for safekeeping.\nNo one will ever come forward to claim it. According to British Law, \nat the expiration of (three) years, the money will revert to the \nownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the \nfund.\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the \nowner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk \nboxes though the security company does not know the contents of the \nboxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export. I am \nwriting you because I as a public servant (Manager with the bank), I \ncannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than \n$1m.\nI want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security \ncompany so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. \nThis is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names \nand address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents \nwhich will put you in place as the as the owner of the boxes.\nThe money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me \nand 30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this \ntransaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the \nsuccessful execution of this transaction.\nIf you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address \nupon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and \nrelevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this \ntransaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall \nrequire your assistance to invest my share in (Buying of properties \nlike houses, hotels and doing charity works etc)\nPlease do send me your private/mobile telephone fax number so that we \ncan have a smooth communication.\nAwaiting your urgent reply ONLY via my email ( \nttss7520062006@mixmail.com )\nThanks and regards.\nTONY SMITH\n\nN.B\nReply me only on this my alternative email\nttss7520062006@mixmail.com\n\n \n\n\n\n\n", "id": "f68d0b96436770411274efc354b7a206"}
