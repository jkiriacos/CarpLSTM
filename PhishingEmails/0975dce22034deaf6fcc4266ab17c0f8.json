JOHN EDWARD.\nBANK OF AFRICA( B.O.A)\nOUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO.\nWEST AFRICAN.\nDear Friend,\n\nI am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department \nof  bank of africa( B.O.A).In my department we discovered an abandoned sum \nof US$30m dollars (THIRTY MILLION US DOLLARS) in an account that belongs to \none of our foreign\ncustomer (MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, Germany) who died along with \nhis entire family in November 2000 in a plane crash. FOR MORE INFORMATION \nVISIT THIS SITE BELOW\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of \nkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \nsome body applies for it\nas next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking \ngildings and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of \nkin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody \nbehind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided \nto make this business proposal to you and release the money to\nyou as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent \ndisbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to \ngo into the bank\ntreasury as unclaimed bill.\n\nThe banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \nunclaimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank \ntreasury as unclaimed fund. The\nrequest of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the \nfact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next \nof kin to a foreigner. I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a \nrespect to the provision of a foreign account , 10% will\nbe set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for \nme Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the \npercentage indicated\nTherefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged, \nyou must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased \nindicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone \nand fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in \nthe money will be remitted.\n\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of \nthe application .\nI will not fail to bring to your notice this transaction is hitch-free and \nthat you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements \nhave been made for the\ntransfer.\n\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.\nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\nYours Faithfully,\nMR. JOHN EDWARD.\nBILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER\nBANK OF AFRICA( B.O.A).\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Hotmail : crez votre adresse e-mail gratuite &  vie ! \nhttp://www.msn.fr/newhotmail/Default.asp?Ath=f\n\n\n\n", "id": "0975dce22034deaf6fcc4266ab17c0f8"}
