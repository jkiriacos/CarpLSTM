{"email_subject": "PROJECT INTEREST.", "email_body": "My dear friend, \n\nI am DR. Yetunde Bassey, Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria,Lagos\nBranch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for\nyou. \n\nOn June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian\nNational Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time\n(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00\n(Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. \n\nUpon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address\nbut got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we\ndiscovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum\nCorporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an \nautomobile accident. \n\nOn further investigation, I found out that he died without making a\nWILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I\ntherefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly\ndid not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,\nincluding his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. \n\nThis sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the\ninterest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each\nyear. No one will ever come forward to claim it. \n\nAccording to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the\nmoney will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody\napplies to claim the fund. \n\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to\nstand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of\nthis old\nman\u00c3f\u00c6'\u00c3?\u00e2?T\u00c3f\u00e2?s\u00c3,\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3f\u00c6'\u00c3,\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3f\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2?s\u00c2\u00ac\u00c3.\u00c2\u00a1\u00c3f\u00e2?s\u00c3,\u00c2\u00ac\u00c3f\u00c6'\u00c3,\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3f\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2?s\u00c2\u00ac\n\u00c3.\u00c2\u00be\u00c3f\u00e2?s\u00c3,\u00c2\u00a2s labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt\ngovernment officials. \n\nThis is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names\nand address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents\nand affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall\nemploy the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the\nWILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of\nprobate/administration in your favor for the transfer.\n\nA bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will\nthen facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the\nbeneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us\nto share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5% would be for\nsettling expenses on my part and yours also for tax when the funds\narrive your country. \n\nThere is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will\nbe done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees\nthe successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested,\nplease reply immediately ONLY via any of my alternate private email\naddresses below otherwise I would not respond to you. \n\nUpon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and\nrelevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.\n\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this\ntransaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall\nrequire your assistance to invest my share in your country.
