{"email_subject": "I NEED YOUR URGENT REPLY", "email_body": "\nGood day\n \nI know this mail might come to you as surprise but kindly allow me the \nopportunity of introducing myself. I am Ms. Aminata Bobi Kabila; \ndaughter of  the former head of state/president of Congo-Kinshasa \n(former \nZaire), Mr. Laurent Desire Kabila. \nI got your particulars through the South African Chamber of Commerce; \nHowever, i am contacting you in order to ask for your assistance on \nthis \nconfidential business proposal with full financial benefit for both my \nfamily and you.\n \nBefore i go into further details, please be informed that i am writing \nwithout any other perso(s) pre-knowledge of my contacting you on this \ntransaction. Therefore i will appreciate same attitude to be maintained \nall through. I have the sum of USD8.5 Million from a secret sale of \nDiamond by my father before he was assassinated by one of his body \nguards \n(Rashid) on January 16th 2001. The essence of this mail is to ask you \nto stand as my foreign partner and receive the fund on my behalf as i \ncan not do much on my own due to security reasons, my narration below \nwill explain better. Before i continue, be well informed that your \nshare \nin this transaction has been calculated at 30% of the total sum, 5% for \nexpenses that may be incurred if any and the rest for my family and me.\n \nMy father as an African traditionalist was a polygamist thereby having \nmarried so many wives, and my mother being the second wife of my \nfather, my step-brother Joseph, who is the current president of my \ncountry, \nis the son of the first wife and he does not have any knowledge about \nthis deal.\n \nAlready president Joseph is using his power to colonise all the money \nand private property which our father left behind for the whole family. \nNow my mother, myself and my younger brother are left with nothing in \nthe inheritance of my late father\ufffds wealth. Our situation is seriously \ncritical that we need your assistance to help us receive this fund for \nrelocation overseas and for proper investment jointly between we and \nyou. Let me quickly assure you the 100% safe proof of this transaction \nbecause the diamond sales are packaged from the onset in a pattern that \nshows no direct trace or linkage with us (Kabila family). At present \nthe \nmoney is in cash and is secured in a security company as family \ntreasures.\nI am waiting for your quick and favourable response, and in case you \nhave any question(s), do not hesitate to contact me urgently.\n \nThanks,\n \nMs. Aminata B. Kabila.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "d21529364f02a6fb57f918af72ff515d"}
