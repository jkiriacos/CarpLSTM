{"email_subject": "US REP", "email_body": "\n\nMy name is Daniel Williams and I am an artist.I live in Netherlands,with my two\nkids, four cats, one dog and the love of my life. It is definitely a full\nhouse. I have been doing artwork since I was a small child. That gives me about\n23 years of experience. I majored in art in high school and took a few college\nart courses. Most of my work is done in either pencil or airbrush mixed with\ncolor pencils. I have recently added designing and creating artwork on the\ncomputer.I have been selling my art for the last 3 years and have had my work\nfeatured on trading cards, prints and in magazines.I have sold in galleries and\nto private collectors from all around the world.I am always facing serious\ndifficulties when it comes to selling my art works to Americans,they are always\noffering to pay with a US POSTAL MONEY ORDER,which is difficult for me to cash\nhere in Netherland.\n\nI am looking for a representative in the states who will be working for me and\nwill be willing to pay %10 for every transaction,which wouldnt affect ur\npresent state of work,someone who would help me recieve payments from my\ncustomers in the states.These payments are in money order and it will be made\npayable to your name, so all you need do is cash the money order deduct your\npercentage and wire the rest back.\n\nIt wouldnt cost you any amount,you are to receive payments which will be sent\nby my customers to you via fedex.\n\nIf you are interested,please get back to me as soon as possible.\n\nRegards\nDaniel Williams\n\n\n", "id": "e64cd8777fb9f169a93bd19161dd0587"}
