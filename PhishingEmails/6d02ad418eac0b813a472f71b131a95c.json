{"email_subject": "Business project", "email_body": "Business project\n\n From Mr.Qin Wang\nLloyds TSB Pacific Limited\nHong Kong Branch\nTwo Exchange Square\nCentral, Hong Kong\nFax: +852-301-66259\n+:852-301-77134\n\nhttp://www.lloydstsb.com.hk\n\nThank you for giving me your time,it is of great importance for you to  \ntake care and understand every word which I have written down below;  \nplease be patient and read my email.\n\nI am a staff of Lloyds TSB Group Plc here in Hong Kong attached in  \nPrivate Banking Services. I am contacting you concerning a customer  \nand an investment placed under our banks management; as a matter of  \nfact it was 3 years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep  \nthe contents of this mail private and also to kindly respect the  \nintegrity of the information you come by as a result of this email.I  \ncontacted you independently of our investigation and no one is  \ninformed of this communication; I would like to intimate you with  \ncertain facts that I believe would be of interest to you.\n\nIn 2000, the subject matter; Ref: FI/TSB/957/048/0532 came to our bank  \nto engage in business discussions with our Private Banking Services  \nDepartment. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 11.37  \nmillion United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over  \n(invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case; I made  \nnumerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief  \noperations officer of the Private Banking Services Department,  \nespecially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank.  \nWe met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed,  \nand however I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with  \nprime ratings. The favored route in my advice to customers is to start  \nby assessing data on 600 traditional stocks and bond managers and 200  \nmanagers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, we spun the  \nmoney around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our  \nfirst months of operation, the accrued profit with interest included,  \nstood at this point at over 13.2 million United States Dollars, this  \nmargin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk  \nguaranteed returns on investments. In mid 2001, he asked that the  \nmoney be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment  \nrequiring cash payments in Europe. He directed that I liquidate the  \nfunds and had it deposited with a firm in Europe.I informed him that  \nour bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and  \nin order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a  \n9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory  \ncharges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I  \nexplained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us.  \nCash movement across borders has become especially strict since the  \nincidents of 9/11.\n\nI contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in  \nmainland Europe, I undertook all the processes and made sure I  \nfollowed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds  \ndeposited in a security consultancy firm, the firm is a specialist  \nprivate firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and  \nblue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake  \ntransactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly  \nprivate organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and  \nwell-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was  \ndeposited; he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his  \narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication  \nwe had, this transpired around February 25th 2002. In June last year,  \nwe got a call from the security firm informing us of the inactivity of  \nthat particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I  \nwas concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking  \nsector I was the only one who knew about the deposit, and I could not  \nunderstand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit.I made  \nfutile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of locating  \nhim to the internal investigations department of our bank. Four days  \nlater, information started to trickle in, that he was apparently dead,  \na person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart  \nattack in Cannes, South of France; we were soon enough able to gather  \nmore information and the cause of death was confirmed. The bank  \nimmediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of  \nkin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his  \nestate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who  \npatronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels  \nof detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he  \nlisted no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an  \naccount with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are  \nrarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the  \naccounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of  \nhaving their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring  \nthat there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they  \nnominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not  \nnominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our  \ncare, in this case; he died in testate.\n\nIn line with our internal processes for account holders who have  \npassed away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to  \ndetermine who should have right to claim the estate, this  \ninvestigation for several months were futile. We have scanned every  \ncontinent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to  \nget to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted  \nin my decision to obtain your contact details and contact you, being  \nas a foreigner or rather non-Asian, as a potential benefactor of the  \nestate even if you are in no way affiliated with this individual (the  \ndeceased).My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to  \nsupervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results  \nof the investigation. What this means, with you being a foreigner, I  \nhave considered the fact that our dear late fellow died with no known  \nor identifiable family member.\n\nThis leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the  \nprevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late  \nbeneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, the firm will by  \nthe end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of  \nclaim to our bank, failing to receive viable claims they will most  \nprobably revert the deposit back to our bank. This will result in the  \nmoney entering our bank's accounting system and the portfolio will be  \nout of my hands and out of the Private Banking Services Department.  \nThis will not happen if I have my way.\n\nWhat I wish to relate to you might be a smack of unethical practice  \nbut I want you to understand something; it is only an outsider to the  \nbanking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world  \naberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught with  \nhuge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain  \nportfolios; you should have begun by now to put together the general  \ndirection of what I propose. There is USD$ 11,991,674 deposited, I  \nalone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no  \none unless I instruct them to do so.I alone know of the existence of  \nthis deposit for as far as the finance firm is concerned, the  \ntransaction with our deceased customer concluded when I sent the funds  \nto the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are  \njust customer services and due process. The finance firm has no single  \nidea of what's the history or nature of the deposit, they are simply  \nawaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes  \nforward, and this is the situation.\n\nThis bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track the family  \nof the deceased; they have investigated for months and have found no  \nfamily but however the investigation has come to an end. My proposal;  \nI am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the finance firm  \nto release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon  \nreceipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in  \nhalf and no more; that is: I will simply nominate you as the next of  \nkin and have them release the deposit to you; afterwards we share the  \nproceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to  \nme, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement  \nin claiming the deposit, but on the other hand, you as a indifferent  \nforeigner would easily pass as the beneficiary with the rights to  \nclaim, I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you in a  \nfew days. I will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the  \nfile relating to the customer, I will then officially communicate with  \nthe finance company and instruct them to release the deposit to you;  \nwith these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to  \nhave the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account  \nholder, this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving  \nthe money from the firm.\n\nWe can fine-tune this based on our interactions, I am aware of the  \nconsequences of this proposal and I ask that if you find no interest  \nin this project that you should discard this mail. I ask also, that  \nyou do not be vindictive or destructive, if my offer is of no appeal  \nto you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you; please  \nnot destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You  \nmay not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums out of  \ncomparable situations run the whole private banking sector, I am not a  \ncriminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this  \nmay be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry  \ndictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way  \nonce in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by and I hope you  \nunderstand, because for once I found myself in total control and face  \nto face with my destiny.\n\nThese chances won't pass me by, I ask that you do not destroy my  \nchance, if you will not work with me please let me know, and hence  \nmove on with my life, but do not destroy me; I am a family man and  \nthis is an occasion to provide them with new opportunities. There is a  \nreward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking, I  \nhave evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you  \nrefusing to work with me and alerting my bank; I am the only one who  \nknows of this situation, good fortune will bless you and plant you  \ninto the center of relevance in my life, let\u0092s share the blessing.\n\nIf you find yourself interested to work with me, please contact me  \nspecifically, through this email account (qin2wang2000@yahoo.com.cn),  \nif you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards  \na conclusion. It is necessary to inform you that under no condition  \nshould you contact me via official channels; I will simply deny  \nknowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you  \ncontacting me through our official lines neither do I want you  \ncontacting me through my official email account. Contact me only  \nthrough this email address above; I do not want any direct link  \nbetween you and me.My official lines are not secure lines as they are  \nperiodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line  \nwith our Total Quality Management policy, please observe this  \ninstruction religiously.\n\nPlease, again, note I am a family man; I happily married with two  \nkids, I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what  \nthe consequences might be, but I know within me that nothing ventured  \nis nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a  \nplatter of gold, this is the one truth I have learned from my private  \nbanking clients; do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one  \naccord, I shall have the pleasure of meeting you after this task has  \nbeen completed plan a meeting, soon.\n\nI await your response.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\nQin.\n\n\n", "id": "6d02ad418eac0b813a472f71b131a95c"}
