Difficulties encountered in efforts\n to secure funds inherited from my fathers business reserve, necessitate\n this search for someone to assist me.\nMy name is Mohammed Abacha, the heir of the abacha family, and son to \nSani Abacha, the Late Nigerian Head of State. I am presently undergoing \ntrial in Abuja though have just been recently granted bail under the \ncondition that my family refunds to the Federal Government some money \nheld in accounts in Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Jersey and in Switzerland.\n In return, all criminal proceedings against members of my family be \ndropped ( a deal which was brokered by the international community).\nTo save the family from total bankruptcy I have managed to ship through \na courier company, the sum of US$12, 000,000.00, kept by my late father.\n This money has become the only inherited property of our family since  \nthe government and its loyalists are bent on making life difficult for \nus by freezing all the family account and has auctioned most of our \nproperties.\n\nThe money has since been deposited with a private finance and\nsecurity firm in Europe. I am willing to offer a percentage agreeable to\n you. All other information required to secure the funds will be given \nto you pending a positive response.\nA quick reply with your name,telephone and fax numbers will be highly \nappreciated.\n\nSincerely yours\n\nMohammed Abacha\n\n\n", "id": "0ad9226f77bdcd0d9150faf1db532fcb"}
