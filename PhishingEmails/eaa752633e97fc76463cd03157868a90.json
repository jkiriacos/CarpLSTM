I have\nall the documents that prove that the money is not a DRUG money and\nalso CERTIFICATE OF ANTI-TERRORISE and MONEY LAUDERING.\nIf you can play the role by sending me your details such as follow:\n\nFull Name:\nContact Address:\nPhone Number:\nAny Form of ID:\n\nI believe it will be wise enough for us to claim the funds instead of\nLeaving it for some group of staffs to share it within them self. The\nLate Mr. Thompson is an American, but he died together with his wife\nand their only daughter on board Alaska Airline flight number 261, on\n31st of January 2000.
