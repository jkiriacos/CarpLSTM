{"email_subject": "CONFIDENTIAL", "email_body": "From: Mr. William Regal\nFinancial Security Assurance\n1 Angel Court, London, EC2R 7HJ\n\n\nDear SIR,\n\nI am Mr. William Regal, the Branch Manager of Financial Security Assurance here in London. \n\nIn my department, I discovered an abandoned sum of US$6,500,000.00 (Six million five hundred thousand united states dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers, who died on 2nd January 2000, along with his entire family as a result of an automobile crash. Since his death none of his relations or next-of-kin has come forward to lay claims for this money as the heir, this is the basically the reason why I have contacted you. We cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our operating guidelines. \n\nIt is upon this discovery I now humbly request your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased, so that the funds can be released in your favor as the beneficiary next of kin. I shall compensate you with 30% of the total sum for your assistance.\n\nPlease, if this proposal is acceptable by you, kindly get back to me via my private email address provided below and furnish me with your full name, address and telephone number. Upon receipt of your mail, I shall bring to your knowledge detailed information on how this deal would be transacted.\n \nI look forward to hearing from you.\n\nKind regards, \n\nMr. William Regal\n \nNB: Please respond to my private email: williamregal@cashette.com\n\n\n\n", "id": "210c78997f649fde9a2d06aa1f59fdf2"}
