My proposition to you, is to seek your consent to present you as the Next of kin and beneficiary of this late client, So that the proceeds of this account valued a huge sum shall be paid to you, and then we can share the amount on a mutually agreed percentage of 30% for you,While 60% for me and others involved, 10% shall be used for miscelenious expenses while the  remainder shall be given to a reputable charity home because the money is owned  by a deceased person.
