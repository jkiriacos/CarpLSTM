Which My bank, now expects a next-of-kin to claim as the beneficiary of the funds, efforts has been made by my Bank to get in touch with the The deceased's Family or relative but to no avail. \n\n\n\nBased on the perceived possibility of not being able to locate The deceased's Family or relative and next-of-kin, the management under the influence of our chairman and the board of directors are making arrangements for the funds to be declared unclaimed and channeled to an unknown account. It is based on this that I have contacted you to stand as the next-of-kin of The deceased or relative so that the funds, will be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary /next-of-kin to the deceased. \n\n\n\nAll documents, and proof to enable you get the funds have been carefully worked out as I have secured from the different offices concerned for the smooth transfer of the fund to your nominated account.
