The payment for the executed contract had \nbeen approved and deposited with our bank in an Escrow account \nwith us at UBA and had a closing balance as at the end of January \n2000, which is worth ($27M) Twenty seven Million United States Dollars.\n\nI was his personal account officer and since the government deposited \nthis money with us in the year 1999, We were instructed by my late \nclient that the money be kept and secured in a security and finance firm \nbecause it was less expensive to keep and secure the funds in the \nsecurity firm devoid of tax payments. \n\nI am sad to inform you that Mr Andreas Schranner, his wife, daughter, \ndaughter inlaw and children died in the ill fated concorde flight AF4590 \nthat crashed into Hotelisimmo on the 31st of July 2000 in Paris-France. \nCheck this website below: \n\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm \n\nOur bank now expects his Next of Kin to come forward as a sole \nbeneficiary to his assets with the bank as accordingto banking laws, \nsuch fund which has stayed more than 5 years without any claim will be \nterminated and be used by the bank as unclaimed fund.
