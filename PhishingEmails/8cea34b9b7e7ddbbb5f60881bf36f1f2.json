We had a  \nMr.Allen Duke, customer that had a deposit of US$4.8M (Four Million  \nEight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) before he died in a  \nplane crash with his wife and only Child about 6years now (January 30,  \n2000) and since he died, we in the Bank here have been expecting  \nhis/her next of kin/relative(s) for the inheritance of the deposit,  \nbut none has surfaced.\n\nThe policy of the Bank however stipulates a limited time period for  \nsuch inheritance to be made or the fund will be written off going by  \nthe record of the incident, the time limit for the claim is closing  \nup. In this consideration, I am contacting you to seek for your kind  \nunderstanding and sincere co-operation to claim this inheritance for  \nour mutual benefit.\n\nIf you can stand as the next of kin in this project, success is  \nassured because I am in possession of the personal file jacket of the  \ndeceased which contains every needed information about the account and  \nthe deceased. You and I stand no risk of any kind because I have  \nenough information to support you in claiming the inheritance.\n\nThe proceedings of the transaction will be shared 50% each after  \nexpenses are reimbursed. Kindly indicate your willingness by email on  \nchriswales@katamail.com and we shall proceed with the initial step for  \nthe claim. The entire project is expected to last for about ten  \nworking days.\n\nPlease kindly get back to me urgently so that we will discuss more on  \nthis issue. Also do not fail to furnish me with your direct phone and  \nfax numbers for easier communication.\n\nBest Regards,\nChris Swales\nEmail:chriswales@katamail.com\n\n\n\n", "id": "8cea34b9b7e7ddbbb5f60881bf36f1f2"}
