{"email_subject": "From Mr. Barry Henry", "email_body": ">From Mr. Barry Henry\nOuter Circle\nRegents Park\nNW3 4RY\nLondon\n\nGood \nDay,\n\nPlease accept my sincere apologizes if my email does not meet \nyour business or personal ethics. I will first introduce myself as Mr. \nBarry Henry, a staff in the Private Clients Section of a well-known \nbank, here in London, England.\n\nOne of our accounts, with holding \nbalance of \u00a315,000,000 (Fifteen Million Pounds Sterling) has been \ndormant and last operated three years ago. From my investigations and \nconfirmation, the owner of the said account, a foreigner by name John \nShumejda died on the 4th of January 2002 in a plane crash in \nBirmingham; you can view this CNN website\n\nhttp://edition.cnn.\ncom/2002/WORLD/europe/01/04/england.plane/\n\nfor details on the crash.\n\nSince then, nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this \nmoney, as he has no family member that has any knowledge as to the \nexistence of either the account or the funds; and also Information from \nthe National Immigration also states that he was single on entry into \nthe UK.\n\nI have confidently discussed this issue with some of the bank \nofficials and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal \nwith. We therefore propose to do business with you, standing in as the \nnext of kin of these funds from the deceased and funds released to you \nafter necessary processes have been followed.\n\nThis transaction is \ntotally free of risk and troubles as the fund is legitimate and does \nnot originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other illegal \nact.\n\nOn your interest, let me hear from you.\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nMr. Barry \nHenry.\n\nPhone Number: +447024078659\nFax Number: +448704792418\n\n\n", "id": "a8c4c2605a48534c940ab7745fdba0ee"}
