{"email_subject": "INVESTMENT NEGOTIATION", "email_body": "Dear Sir,\n   \nI am Amina Idris from the State of Kassala in the Eastern part of Sudan. I recently lost my husband who until his death was a serving officer with the SPLA here in Sudan. He died in the cause of performing his duties under the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS).\n\nBefore his death he was privileged to have served close the powers that be in my country and this exposed him to huge sums of money of which about $7.5 Million was left to my surviving son and I.\n\nI am contacting you because I need a big favor from you as regards receiving these funds on our behalf and help us invest it in a profitable venture. Due to my inexperience in matters of business, I am willing to give free rein of affairs to you in the day to day running of such a business venture.\n\nPlease if you are willing to assist me, don\ufffdt hesitate to reply and indicate your interest as soon as possible.\n\nThanks and best regards.\n\n\nAmina Idris\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "ea29230dab926f4a745f7cdfbb4ed2bd"}
