Please  even if we never \nknew before, I believe firmly that on the basis of the right of \nhumanitarian assistance that a real confidence and love can arise from \nour communication and  also a real partnership between  us. \n\nI am Miss Medine ZACHI , the legitimate daughter of the Director of \ncocoa export here murdered by the rebelles here because of the \npolitical crisis going on here since four years ago. \n\nMy father had deposited a consignment  with a  security company here  \ncontaining the sum of  $9.000,000 USD (Nine million dollars USD) To \nallow him to conceive a project of investment at the end of his mandate \nhere. \n\nRegrettably the fate decided on it otherwise. \n\nToday my major concern  is to move out  this sum outside here. Given \nthat I am the only child and I have seriously suffered from the \nraggings and the harassments on behalf of the political opponents of my \nFather.\n\nIt is in this prospect that I contact you  to please help me  to move \nthis heritage  from the security company to your country.\n\nBecause of the political war and the hostilities in this country  I \nseriously wish to leave from here and  live the rest of my life in a \nmore peaceful and politically more stable and quiet country. It is  \nwhat justifies  this demand. \n\nI shall voluntarily agree on a good and appropriate percentage of this \nmoney as your compensation for your assistant as for what precedes. \n\nI would like to count on your human, virtuous and professional \nqualities. \nI look forward to recive your urgent responds.\nThanks for your care .\n\nYours sincerely\nMiss Medine\n\n\n", "id": "d80a055905a935e37d00694e18983d66"}
