{"email_subject": "GOOD DAY SIR", "email_body": "\nGreetings, My Friend,\n\nPermit me to introduce first myself then the purpose of this letter.\n\nI am Mr PAPA BELLO, Bank Manager of ORIENT BANK OF NIGERIA, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very\nconfidential business proposition for you and it is carefully explained for your understanding as follows.\n\nOn June 6 1997, an American oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,\nMr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time account (Fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at\nUS$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million United States Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine\nnotification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally\nwe discovered from his contract employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly\nhas since died from an automobile accident.\n\nOn further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin\nwere fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare\nany next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of\nUS$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of\neach year. No one will come forward to claim it. According to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5\n(five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.\n\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.\nBarry Kelly so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some undeserving and\ncorrupt officials.\n\nThis is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with the following; your full names, date\nand place of birth and complete address with confidential telephone and fax numbers so that the\nattorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of\nkin. We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the\nnecessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.\n\nA bank account in any part of the world, which you would provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this\nmoney to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share\nin the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for\nthis transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the\nsuccessful execution of this transaction.\n\nIf you are interested, Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant\ndocuments that will help you understand. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this\ntransaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest\nmy share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply via e-mail.\n\nThanks and regards,\n\nMr PAPA BELLO.\n\n\n\n", "id": "e028599033f2922e135428a3171e3b38"}
