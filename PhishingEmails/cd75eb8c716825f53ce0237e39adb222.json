{"email_subject": "CONFIDENTLY", "email_body": "Magnum Funds\n25 Maiden Lane \nCovent Garden \nLondon WC2E 7JS\n\n\nHello,\n\nDo accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet your personal ethics.\nI will introduce myself as Mr.Robbin Kuuk, a staff in the accounts management\nsection of the above firm here in the United Kingdom. \n\nOne of our accounts with holding balance of \u00a315,000,000(Fifteen Million\nBritish Pounds) has been dormant and has not been operated for the past\nfour (4) years. \n\n>From my investigations and confirmations, the owner of this account, a foreigner\nby name Kurt Kahle died in July, 2000  and since then nobody has done anything\nas regards the claiming of this money because he has no family members who\nare aware of the existence of neither the account nor the funds. \n\nI have secretly discussed this matter with a senior official of this company\nand we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. We thus\npropose to do business with you, standing in as the next of kin of these\nfunds from the deceased and funds released to you after due processes have\nbeen followed. \n\nThis transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is legitimate\nand does not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other\nillegal act. On receipt of your response I will furnish you with detailed\nclarification as it relates to this mutual benefit transaction. I look forward\nto hearing from you as soon as possible if you are interested.\n \n\nRegards, \n\nMr.Robbin Kuuk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "cd75eb8c716825f53ce0237e39adb222"}
