{"email_subject": "EXCESS PROFIT", "email_body": "\n \nHello,\n \nI write to solicit your assistance in a funds transfer deal involving US$ 3.5M.This fund has been stashed out of the excess profit made last year by this branch of the International Commercial Bank which I am the manager. I have already submitted an approved end of the year report for the year 2005 to my head office here in Accra-Ghana and they will never know of this excess. I have since then, placed this amount on a Non-Investment Account without a beneficiary.\n\nUpon your response, I will configure your name on our database as holder of the Non-Investment Account. I will then guide you on how to apply to my head office for the Account Closure/ bank-to-bank remittance of the funds to your designated bank account.\n\nIf you concur with this proposal, I intend for you to retain 30% of the funds while 70% shall be for me.\n \nKindly forward your response to: toneyak05@yahoo.es\n \nWith Regards,\nAnthony Aka\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "6023015b32da4a51f765867f37541c62"}
