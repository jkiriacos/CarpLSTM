My late husband was\n very wealthy and after his death,I inherited all his business \n and wealth.The doctor has advised me that I\n will not live for more than 2 months, so I have now\n decided to spread all my wealth, to contribute mainly\n to the development of charity in Africa, America, Asia\n and Europe.\n\n Before my late husband died he was a major oil tycoon,\n in dubai and deposited the sum of 20 million dollars\n (Twenty million dollars) in a security company in europe some\n years ago,thats all i have left now,i need you to collect this funds \n and distribute it yourself to charity.\n so that when i die my soul can rest in peace.\n the funds will be entirely in hands and management.\n I pray God gives you the wisdom to touch\n very many lives,that is my main concern.\n \n 20% of this money will be for your time and effort,\n while 80% goes to charity.\n\n God bless you.\n Mrs. Maryam Ibrahim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "4639d19a5c674f5e448475bcad350a3c"}
