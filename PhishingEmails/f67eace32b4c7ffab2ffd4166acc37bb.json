{"email_subject": "+From Portugal & Urgent Reply Needed +", "email_body": "\n\n\n>From . Mr. Richard Williams.\nDate: 17 -05 -2007.\n\nKindest Attention:\n\nMy name is Mr. Richard Williams. I am from Portugal .  I have been\ndiagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical\ntreatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according\nto medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I\nnever really cared for anyone (not even myself)but my business.  Though I\nam very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and\nonly focused on my business as\nthat was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now\nknow that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the\nmoney in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to\nthis world I\nwould live my life a different way from how I have lived it.\n\nNow that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property\nand assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few\nclose friends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I\nhave decided\nto give alms to charity organizations and those in Need, as I want this to\nbe one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have Distributed\nmoney to some charity organizations when I was well. Now that my health\nhas deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked\nmembers of my family to\nclose one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to\ncharity organization in United States, Asia, Middle East & Europe, they\nrefused and kept the money to themselves.\n\nHence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with\nwhat I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is\nthe huge cash deposit of Twenty Million United States Dollars ($20, 000,\n000.00) that I\nhave with an Asset Management / Vaulting Company Abroad. I will want you\nto help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations\nand use it to help those in Need.\n\nN/B:Kindly note that  40% of this funds must go to  victims of Tsunami,\nHurricane Katrina , Hurricane Wilma and South Asia Earthquake , 55% to\nother Charity Organizations around the World and 5%  for your effort and\ntime.\n\nI cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation, as I am\nusing my Lap Top Computer to communicate with you. You should respond to\nthis e-mail if you are interested in carrying out this assignment on my\nbehalf.\n\n\nGod be with you.\n\nMr. Mr. Richard Williams.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "f67eace32b4c7ffab2ffd4166acc37bb"}
