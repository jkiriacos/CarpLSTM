Efforts had been made by the \nmanagement of my bank through the German Embassy in johannesburg to contact\nany of the deceased children but to no avail,as we were made to understand\nhe  had no children.Given the skeletal information available to the bank,\nit has so far been impossible to reach any of the relatives.\n\nThe situation left for the Management is to declare the deceased\naccount dormant and revert the Amount to trading on behalf of the interest\nof the Bank.
