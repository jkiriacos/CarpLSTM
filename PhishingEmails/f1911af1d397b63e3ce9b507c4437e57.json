I do not wish to tak\ne your time with a lenghty mail, but i have to put this proposal to you so\nthat you can assist me.\n        While i was still in contact with Qusay,he made a deposit in my\nname to a security firm in\nSpain, which has an affiliate branch in Amsterdam.\nThis deposit was made in my name and the secret code and necessary\ndocuments are presently in\nthe possession of an attorney, presently in Spain.\n   This deposit was made in the form of a consigment and the content is a\nconsiderable amount of\nmoney in United state dollars which i cannot disclose to you for security\npurposes, until you have\nconfirmed your willingness to assist me.\n I would be pleased and grateful to you if you could assist me in\ncollecting this consignment on my\nbehalf from the security firm in Spain, upon which i will be offering you a\npercentage for your\nefforts.\n  The attorney in Spain, will arrange an authority to release and pay in\nyour name which you will\ntender to the security firm coupled with all necessary documents that will\nback up your claims in\ncollecting this consignment on my behalf.\n  I have to stop here now as your response will determine our\nsubsequent corresspondence.
