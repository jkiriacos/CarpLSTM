{"email_subject": "Re: the issue", "email_body": "Dear Sir,\nMy name is Mohammed Hamid, I am from Iraq. My cousin was a top officer in the former Government of Sadam Hussein. Before the beginning of the war he gave me 75,000,000.00 (Seventy Five Million United States Dollars) to keep for him.\nI managed to move the box containing the money out of Iraq through diplomatic immunity to a Security company in London , U.K  and the box is been deposited as family treasure, for security reasons. Now that the war is over I want to move the money to your country for safety reasons. Be rest assured that this transaction is risk free as no person is aware of this money. \nYou will be compensated with 25% of the total sum, if you can assist. Expecting your urgent reply via mohammed@fsmail.net   .\nYours Faithfully, \n\nMohammed .\n\n", "id": "a2e150cf891baa3f7911d982de4c4183"}
