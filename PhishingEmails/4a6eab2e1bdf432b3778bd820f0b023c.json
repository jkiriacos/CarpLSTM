This money is genareted from oil\nand it is legal.\nBut the only way we can move the money is through diplomatic means,not to\nlondon for security reason but to africa first before transferring to an bank of\nyour choice. The most important thing is can we trust you? Once the funds\nget to you, you will take 20% of the total sum,while 75% will be for us.the\n5% stands to cover all expenses.\nYour own part of this deal is to give us all assistance needed\n If you are interested I will furnish you with more\ndetails.
