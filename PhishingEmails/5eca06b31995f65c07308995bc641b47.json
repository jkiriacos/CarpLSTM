WOMA LEE THE MANAGER FOREIGN REMITTANCE\nDEPARTMENT,\nAFRICA DEVELOPMENT BANK(ADB)\nBURKINA FASO.\n\nDear Partner,\n\n(TOP SECRET)\n\nI am DR WOMA LEE, the manager in charge of\nauditing and accounting\nsection of Africa Development Bank.AFRICA\nDEVELOPMENT BANK(ADB) Ouagadougou\nBurkina-faso West Africa ,with due respect and\nregard. I have decided to\ncontact you on a business transaction that will be\nvery beneficial to both\nof us at the end of the transaction .\n\nDuring our investigation and auditing in this bank,\nmy department came\nacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a\ndeceased person Mr.Andreas\nSchranner who who died with his wife and their only\ndaughter on July 2000 in\na plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his\naccount with this Bank\nwithout any claim of the fund in our custody either\nfrom his family or\nrelation before our discovery to this development.\n\nThe said amount was U.S $10.150M ((Ten million one\nhundred and fiftythousand\nUS dolloars)). As it may interest you to know, I got\nyour impressive\ninformation through internation search in\nBurkina-faso here in Ouagadougou\nBurkina-faso.\n\nMeanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim\nover this fund as the\nbonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the\nrequired approval and transfer\nthis money to a foreign account has been put in\nplace and directives and\nneeded information will be relayed to you as soon as\nyou indicate your\ninterest and willingness to assist me and also\nbenefit your self to this\ngreat business opportunity.\n\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but\nbecause of my position in this\ncountry as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not\nallowed to operate a foreign\naccount and would eventually raise an eye brow on my\nside during the time of\ntransfer because I work in this bank. This is the\nactual reason why it will\nrequire a second party or fellow who will forward\nclaims as the next of kin\nwith affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also\npresent a foreign\naccount where he will need the money to be\nre-transferred into on his\nrequest as it may be after due verification and\nclarification by the\ncorrespondent branch of the bank where the whole\nmoney will be remitted from\nto your own designation bank account.\n\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction\nis 100% risk free. On\nsmooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be\nentitled to 40% of the\ntotal sum as gratification, while 60% will be for\nme. Please, you have been\nadviced to keep \"top secret\" as I am still in\nservice and intend to retire\nfrom service after we conclude this deal with you.\n\nI will be monitoraing the whole situation here in\nthis bank until you\nconfirm the money in your account and ask me to come\ndown to your country\nfor subsequent sharing of the fund according to\npercentages previously\nindicated and further investment, either in your\ncountry or any country you\nadvice us to invest in. All other necessary\ninformation will be sent to you\nwhen I hear from you.\nTrusting to hear from you. you can contact me\nthrough this number(226\n76440063).\n\nYou can visit the sit\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm\n\n\nYours faithfully,\nDR.
