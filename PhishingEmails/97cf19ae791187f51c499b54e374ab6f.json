{"email_subject": "GET BACK IMMEDIATELY", "email_body": "My Dear Friend,\n\nGreetings:\n\nI am sorry for sending you this message for the second time, please bear \nwith me and respond.\nMy name is Mr. Melvin Samson I work as an accountant in a bank; I contacted \nyou to work together with me in claiming my late client's estate. \nUnfortunately he died without a registered next of kin and as such the funds \nnow have an open beneficiary status. You could be made the beneficiary since \nyou share the same last name with him.\n\nThis has officially transferred the right to you, as no other person from \nhis family knows anything about this fund with our bank.If you are \ninterested in working with me,\n\nplease get back to me as quickly as possible so that I give you the details \nof what we are to  do. I wait for your prompt response so that I can give \nyou more briefing of what you need to and how to do it.\n\nThanks for your co-operation.\n\nBest regards,\n\nMelvin.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nWindows Live Messenger has arrived.
