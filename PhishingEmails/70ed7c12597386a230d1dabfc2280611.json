I got your contact address through \ninternet net work search when searching for a good and reliable person that \nwill assist me in this transaction.\n\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 22.85m US Dollars ( \ntwenty two milllion eight hundred and Fifty thousand us dollars)in an \naccount thatbelongs to one of our foreign customer who died on 25th JULY \n2001 IN SUPER SONIC CONCORDE plane crash AT CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT IN \nPARIS FRANCE\nalong with his entire family.\n\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of \nkin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless \nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \nindicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his \nsupposed\nnext of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving \nnobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I \ndecided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you \nas the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent \ndisbursement since nobody is coming for it and i don't want this money to\ngo into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.\n\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained \nunclamed after four year, the money will be transfered into the Bank \ntreasury as unclaimed fund.\n\nThe request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by \nthe fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as \nnext of kin to a foreigner.\n\nI agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in \nrespect to the provision of a foreign account and 70% would be for ME;\n\nTherefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, \nyou must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased \nindicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone \nand fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in\nthe money will be remitted.\n\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of \nthe application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this \ntransaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear \nas all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.\n\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail through \nmy private line.\nYour's faithfully\nMR.
