{"email_subject": "GOODDAY TO YOU!!!", "email_body": "FROM THE DESK OF:\nMR XIAO GANG,\nBANK OF OVERSEAS CHINESE\nTAIPEI,TAIWAN\n\n\nDear Friend,\n\nHow are you today and business in your country? I am Mr.Xiao Gang, Bank \nManager,Bank Of Overseas Chinese North Shyn Lin District, Taipei, Taiwan. I \nwould respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail \nconfidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a \nresult of this mail. I contacted you independently of our investigation and no \none is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with \ncertain facts that I believe would be of interest to you. I know you would be \nwondering why I am writing you with a request such as this but I only urge you \nto read on.\n\nIn November 1998, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Chinese Solid \nMinerals Corporation, Mr. Mark Kogan, made a Fixed Deposit  of the sum of \nUS$10,000,000.00 (Ten Million United States Dollars) which accumulated  to the \nsum of US$20,160,176.00 (Twenty Million, One hundred and sixty thousand, One \nhundred and seventy six United States Dollars for twelve calendar months in my \nbranch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address \nin America and Britain but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and \nfinally we discovered from his contract employers, the Chinese Solid Minerals \nCorporation that Mr.Mark Kogan died alongside his wife, from an airplane \ncrash. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving \nnext of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his \nestate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize \nour services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from \nconventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the \nfield of private banking, opening an account with us means no one will know of \nits existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers \nand codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to \ndepositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, \nensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they \nnominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not nominating next \nof kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; Mr. \nMark Kogan died interstate. In line with our internal processes for account \nholders who have passed away, we instituted our own investigations in good \nfaith to determine who should have right to claim the estate. This \ninvestigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned every \ncontinent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the \nroot of the problem. This sum of US$20,160,176.00 has since been sitting in my \nBank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end \nof each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.\n\nAccording to the Laws of Republic of China, at the expiration of 5 (five) \nyears, the money will revert to the ownership of the Chinese Government if \nnobody applies to claim the funds. What I wish to relate to you will smack of \nunethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an \noutsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking \nworld aberrational. The world of banking especially is fraught with huge \nrewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. \nYou should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I \npropose. There is US$20,160,176.00 deposited in my bank, I alone have the \ndeposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless evidence of \nrelationship with the deceased, which I shall provide you with, is presented. \nI alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as Bank of overseas \nchinese is concerned, the bank's management has no single idea of what\u0092s the \nhistory or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting instructions to \nrelease the deposit to any party that comes forward. This is the situation. \nThis bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man\u0092s family; \nthey have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation \nhas come to an end. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a \nforeigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. mark kogan so that the fruits \nof this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt \ngovernment officials. Acting in this capacity really is simple, all you have \nto do is provide your full names and address so that an attorney here can \nprepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as \nthe next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and \nnotarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary authentication, approval \nand a letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer to be \ndone. A bank account in any part of the world that you then provide me with \nwill then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next \nof kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share 90/10.\n\nI am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no \ninterest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do \nnot be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete \nthis message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because \nyou do not approve of my proposal. You may not know this but people like \nmyself who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole \nprivate banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do, I do not find \nagainst good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the \ndynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities \nonly come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, \nfor once I find myself in total control of my destiny. This is my chance and i \nwont let it pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will \nnot work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not \ndestroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide my family \nwith new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task \nwell worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have \nhere is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. There is no \nrisk whatsoever as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the \nattorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantee the successful \nexecution of this transaction. If you are interested in this lucrative role, I \nurge you to indicate to that effect. Upon your response, if favourable, I \nshall then provide you with more details and relevant information that will \nhelp you get full understanding of the transaction. I will appreciate it if \nyou send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easier \ncommunication.\n\nIf you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this email \naddress. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards \na conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official \nchannels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not \nwant you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you \ncontacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through the \nnumbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. My \nofficial lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to \nassess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management \nPolicy. Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am \na family man, I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a \nmeasure of fear as to what the consequences may be, but I know within me that \nnothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy \nor on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have learned from my private \nbanking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, we \nshould plan a meeting, soon.\n\nIn closing, please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that \nthis transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall \nrequire your assistance to invest my share in your country. Upon receiving \nyour reply, I will then furnish you with a more comprehensive detail of this \ntransaction and what is required of you.\n\n\nPlease respond to my alternative mail box  xg1002003@yahoo.com.tw\n\n\nAwaiting your urgent reply.\nYours Sincerely,\nMr. Xiao Gang.\n\n", "id": "12f99a52b9d1da95098c8cb3fe2b64c8"}
