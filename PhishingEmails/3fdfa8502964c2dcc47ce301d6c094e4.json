{"email_subject": "REPLY SOON", "email_body": "Dear Friend,\n\nAs you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for \nme, because, I believe everyone will die someday. \nMy name is BATES ALAN a merchant in Dubai, in the \nU.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer.\nIt has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now \nI have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. \nI have not particularly lived my life so well, as I \nnever really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my \nbusiness. Though I am very rich, I was never \ngenerous, I was always hostile to people and only \nfocused on my business as that was the only thing I \ncared for. But now I regret all this as I now know \nthat there is more to life than just wanting to have \nor make all the money in the world. \nI believe when God gives me a second chance to come \nto this world I would live my life a different way \nfrom how I have lived it. Now that God has called \nme, I have willed and given most of my property \nand assets to my immediate and extended family \nmembers as well as a few close friends. \nI want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul \nso, I have decided to give alms to charity \norganizations, as I want this to be one of the last \ngood deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed \nmoney to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, \nAlgeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has \ndeteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself \nanymore. I once asked members of my family to close one \nof my accounts and distribute the money which I have \nthere to charity organization in Bulgaria and \nPakistan, they refused and kept the money to \nthemselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as \nthey seem not to be contended with what I have left \nfor them. \nThe last of my money which no one knows of is the \nhuge cash deposit of eighteen million dollars \n$18,000,000,00 that I have with a finance/Security Company \nabroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit \nand dispatched it to charity organizations.\nI have set aside 10% for you and for your time.\nGod be with you. \nBATES ALAN\n\n", "id": "3fdfa8502964c2dcc47ce301d6c094e4"}
