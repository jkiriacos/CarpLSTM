The owner of this account, ENGR. SMITH U. WILLIAMS, a foreigner, the manager of Petro- technical support services, a chemical Engineer by profession and he died in 1990 and no other person knows about this account or any other beneficiary. My investigations prove to me as well that this company does not know anything about this account and has no attachment to the said amount. The amount involved is 56 MILLION USD (FIFTY-SIX MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) ONLY. \n\nIn the light of the fact, I needed your assistance to open your door to this opportunity by providing your account or any account of your choice where the fund will be remitted. I want to transfer this money into a safe foreigners account abroad but I dont know any one who could actually assist, I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can only be approved to a foreign account because the money is in US Dollars and the owner of the account ENGR. SMITH U. WILLIAMS and a foreigner too. \n\nI know that this mail will come as surprise to you as we dont know ourselves, but be sure that is for real.
