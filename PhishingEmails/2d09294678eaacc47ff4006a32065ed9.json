No other person knows \nabout this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other \nbeneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this company does \nnot know anything about this account and the amount involved is (USD 45M) Forty \nFive million United States Dollars). \n\nI want to transfer the [USD45M] Forty Five million United States Dollars into a \nsafe foreigners account abroad , but I don't know any foreigner, \nI am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved \nto a local bank here, but can only be approved to any foreign account \nbecause the money is in us dollars and the former owner of the \naccount Mr.Destin Pal,was a foreigner too. \n\nI know that this message will come to you as a surprise as we don\ufffdt know ourselves before,\nbut be sure that it is real and a genuine business.

I want us to meet face \nto face or sign a binding agreement to bind us together so that you can receive \nthis money into a foreign account or any account of your choice where the fund \nwill be safe. I will fly to your country for withdrawal and sharing and other \ninvestments. I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner \nwith foreign account and foreign beneficiary. \n\nI need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the management is \nready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this \naccount, which I will give to you later immediately, if you are able and with capability to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust according to my instructions and advice \nfor our mutual benefit because this opportunity will never come again in my \nlife.
