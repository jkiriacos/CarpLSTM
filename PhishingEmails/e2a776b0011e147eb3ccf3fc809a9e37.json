{"email_subject": "ATTENTION", "email_body": "Dear friend,\n                                      \nMy name is Mr. Fredrick Andrew. I trained and work as an external auditor for the Development Bank of\nSingapore (DBS) of Singapore. I have taken pains to find your contact through personal endeavours because\na late investor,who bears the same last name with you has left monies totaling a little over $10 million\nUnited States Dollars with Our Bank for the past twelve years and no next of kin has come forward all\nthese years.\nBanking regulation legislation in Singapore demand that I notify the fiscal authorities after a statutory\ntime period of twelve years when dormant accounts of this type are called in by the monetary regulatory\nbodies. The above set of facts underscores my reason of writing.I am of the settled conviction that using\nmy insider leverage, working with you,since you have the same last Name with the Late Investor, we can\nsecure the funds in the account for us instead of allowing it pass as unclaimed funds into the coffers\nof the Government of Singapore. This exactly is why I\ncrave your participation and cooperation.\nI have seized all relevant information (legal and Banking) that will facilitate our putting you forward\nas the claimant/beneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer the money to any account nominated\nby you. Be assured that I and my colleagues are on top of the situation all the time and there will be no\nrisk . Needless to say, Uttermost CONFIDENTIALITY is of vital importance if we are to successfully reap the\nimmense benefits of this transaction. I have intentionally left out the finer details for now until\nI hear from you. To affirm your willingness and cooperation to my proposal please do so by email,\nstating your full names, date of birth, telephone\nnumber and fax number. I do expect your prompt\nresponse. \nThank you.\nMr. Fredrick  \n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "e2a776b0011e147eb3ccf3fc809a9e37"}
