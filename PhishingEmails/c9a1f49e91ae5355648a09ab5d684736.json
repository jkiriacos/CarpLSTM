I am presently in Europe, where I \nintend to look for a credible business partner to \nassist my brother and I take physical pocession of a \nconsignment of money, precisely US$25,500,000:00 \n(Twenty five million five hundred thousand united \nstates dollars) which my uncle kept under the custody \nof my father in a security company in Ghana. \n\nMy parents was killed along with my uncle, and in his \nwill he clearly stated that my brother and I should \nlook for a credible individual who would assist us in \ninvesting these funds, as we are not conversant with \ninvestment procedures in the world business and we \nhave never been in posession of such funds all our \nlives. For these reasons, he believes that the only \nway we can live without him is if we get someone very \nvast in the field of business and investment to help \nus claim the funds and invest it on our behalf, so we \ncan further our educations, as well as living our \nlives the way he wants us to. \n\nMy brother is in Ghana, looking after the money in the \nsecurity company, and he has asked that I travel out \nto Europe to look for a foreign partner to assist us. \nI would furnish you with his telephone numbers as soon \nas I receive your response, so you can deal with him \ndirectly, as he has all the modalties for the release \nof the consignment. \n\nWe have both decided that we would make available to \nyou for your assistance, 15% of the total sum of money \ninvolved, but we have also decided to leave it open to \nnegotiation. \n\nI would give you more details as soon as I hear from \nyou. Till then I expect your prompt response. \n\nYours faithfully \n\nVENUS SAVIMBI \n\nN:B. REPLY TO:  venusavimbi02@themail.com\n \n \n \n\n", "id": "c9a1f49e91ae5355648a09ab5d684736"}
