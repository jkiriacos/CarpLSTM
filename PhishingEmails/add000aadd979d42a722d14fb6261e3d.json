I am Mr \nABDUL UMAR, the director in charge of auditing and accounting section of \nBANQUE GENERALE DU TOGO, Lome Togo in west Africa.  With due respect and \nregard. I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that\nwill be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction.\n\nDuring our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came \nacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died on \n31st October 1999 in a plane crash;flight number 990 en route from new york \nto cairo which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean killing the 217\npassengers and crew members on board and the fund has been dormant in his \naccount with this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either \nfrom his family or relation before our discovery to this development.\n\nAlthough personally, I keep this information secret within myself and \npartners to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful \nduring the time of execution. The said amount was us$14M (fourteen million \nunited states dollars).  As it may interest you to know, I got your\nimpressive information from the web directory of my country when searching \nfor a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who could help me champion a \nbusiness proposal of such magnitude without any problem.\n\nMeanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the \nbonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer \nthis money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and \nneeded information will be relayed to you as soon as\nyou indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit \nyour self to this great business opportunity.\n\nIn fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this \ncountry as a civil servant, we are not allowed to operate a foreign account \nand would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time of \ntransfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it\nwill require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of \nkin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also present a foreign \naccount where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on his \nrequest as it may be after due verification and clarification by the\ncorrespondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted from \nto your own designation bank account.\n\nI will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free.\n\nOn smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 20% of the \ntotal sum as\ngratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of expenses that may \narise during the time of transfer and also telephone bills, while 75% will \nbe for me and my partners.\n\nPlease, you have been adviced to keep top secret as we are still in active \nservice and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with \nyou.  I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you \nconfirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your\ncountry for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages \npreviously indicated and further investment, either in your country or any \ncountry you advice us to invest in.\n\nAll other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you. I \nsuggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in this \ndeal on my confidential email address: abdul_umar1@canada.com\n\nYours faithfully,\nMR.ABDUL UMAR.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "add000aadd979d42a722d14fb6261e3d"}
