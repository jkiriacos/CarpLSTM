After the reassignment, the\namount would be transferred to your bank account.\nThe principal amount of the POF is US$50 Million, and I have already\nworked out modalities to execute the transfer successfully; hence I\nask of you to confirm ASAP whether or not you are interested.\nThe BOE is an irrevocable Bank Operative Instrument, which you can\nuse as collateral to bank against a loan immediately we fully reassign to\nyou, which means your bank can even borrow against it. I shall send\nyou evidence of funds which once can still through bank-to-bank confirm\nexistence.\nI would appreciate that you get back to me upon receipt of this\nimportant mail on your opinion towards a lasting business\nrelationship.\n\nRespectfully,\nWilliams Morrow\n\n\n", "id": "8746f776e59ce3ea4c4f8b9caa0a9543"}
