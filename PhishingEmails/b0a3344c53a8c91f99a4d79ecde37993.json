{"email_subject": "Please get back to me as soon as possible.", "email_body": "Goodday,\n\nIt's been so difficult getting across to you, I do hope you will contact me as soon as you read this \nmail for a very urgent matter. Please it is absolutely necessary that you get back to me immediately.\n\nIn brief, I am financial adviser to a private security firm in Bangkok, Thailand. Lately my department\ndiscovered fund deposited by a Mr. Saeed Bin Khadir, an Iraqi national. The fund was deposited since\nApril 2003, and till this moment Mr. Saeed has not been located. Our extensive inquiry shows that he\nmay have been one of those killed in Iraqi by bomb. All efforts to locate a family member or next of kin\nresulted in nothing. At long last, I and my immediate boss decided to look for honest individual who \ncould be fronted as Mr. Saeed's business partner so that we could move the fund to the third country, for \ninvestment purposes. \n\nI will provide you with the rest of the details if you indicate your interest in helping us out, you will\nbe rewarded accordingly.\n \nPlease get back to me on this email: \nm_bornwick@adexec.com\nm_bornwick2@yahoo.com\n\n\nM.
