{"email_subject": "KINDNES NEEDED.", "email_body": "FROM: Barrister Anthony Efe.\nTEL: 234-803-581-4937.\n\n     I am Barrister Anthony Efe, an International Legal Practitioner and a \nConsultant to Mrs. Stella Olusegun Obasanjo, (WIFE)  to the president of \nFederal Republic of Nigeria. Unfortunately, my client Mrs. Stella Olusegun \nObasanjo died on Saturday October 22nd, 2005. For details of her death \nvisit:\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/africa/10/23/obasanjo.obituary/index.html\n          Before the untimely death of my client, she had through a security \ncompany here in Nigeria moved the sum of US$20.5m to Europe and was to \nproceed to Netherlands from Spain where she went just for medial check-up  \nimmediately after the check-up to complete arrangements and have this money \nDeposited into ABN AMRO BANK and already the security company where the \nfunds was deposited has sent notice to me requesting that this funds should \nbe claimed by the depositor (My Client) or her next of kin within 14 working \ndays, thinking that they are to take the funds just the way some   \nsecurities companies did to one of our late presidents wife and her family \n(Mrs. Maryam Abacha)  else the fund will be forfeited to the state, with \nsuch the husband wouldn\ufffdt like or wish to hear this from the press or any \none. I must confess to you that if I do not find a way to bring this fund \nout of the Finance Company, I will be doing the greatest injustice to my \nlate client and her family. This is why I decided for you to stand in as a \nnext of kin or her business partner who was supposed to receive the funds \nfor investment in Europe. There are no risks involved as I am the only \nperson who has access to my client's documents. The Finance firm has just \nsent a reminder to my client through me, informing her of the maturity of \nher fund. Your compensation for your assistance in securing the fund is \nsubject to negotiations. I need the following information from you. Your \nfull names,address,telephone and Fax numbers. Also Copy of your \nIdentification. Reply urgently, as we must conclude this transaction within \nthe next 14 working days Sincerely,\nBarrister Anthony Efe.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "747d21dc7fe4dd57caad5b4a1ca67156"}
