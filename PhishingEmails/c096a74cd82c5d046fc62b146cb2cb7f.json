I write you this\nletter in good faith and trust and expected you to keep it\nconfidential. Also I hoped you will not be embarrassed as\nwhy I contacted you. I have that conviction to contacted you\nhoping all will be with your full co-operation.\n\nI am in control of the sum of one million, eight hundred\nand fifty thousand US dollars ($1,850,000),an excess profit\nmade by our regional branch in the last quarter of the year\n2004. I have carefully placed the fund in an Escrow Call\nDeposit Account and did not declare it to my head office,\nwhile accounting for the end of the year fiscal profits.\n\nCan I really trust you to hold this money for me until I\narrive your country and pick it up myself and you deduct 30%\nof the total money as your remuneration? If you accept my\noffer you can contact me immediately. If you do not accept\ncan you forget I contacted you?\n\nI want you to get me a good current account in your\ncountry where I can move this money. I will discreetly give\nyou all the information concerning the account so that you\ncan apply to our Head Office for the transfer of the money\nto your account.\n\nYou shouldn't be afraid, as it will be just a smooth\nbank-to-bank transfer. There is practically no danger to\nyour person.\n\nI am hoping for your perfect understanding of my situation\nand position.\n\nThanks\nMike\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "c096a74cd82c5d046fc62b146cb2cb7f"}
