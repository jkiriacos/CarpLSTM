{"email_subject": "GOOD DAY...", "email_body": "Dear Friend,\n\nI am Mr.Vincent Nicholas, I am an accountant with the HSBC BANK UK.I\nam very sorry if this is an inconvinience in any way, just that i\nneed you to see me through with this transfer. This business request\nmay seem strange, but I crave your indulgence and pray you view it\nseriously as I am convinced that you would be capable to provide me\nwith a solution to a money transfer.\n\nOn June 16, 2000, a German property magnate Mr. Andrea Schranner\nmade a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar\nmonths,valued at \ufffd6,500,000.00(Six Million Five Hundred Thousand\nPounds Sterling )in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine\nnotification to his forwarding address but got no reply.\nAfter a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from\nhis contract employers (the Petroleum Corporation) that Mr. Andrea\nSchranner died in an air crash with his family. \nOn further investigation, I found out that he died without making a\nwill and attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I\ntherefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Andrea\nSchranner did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his\nofficial documents, including his bank deposit paperwork. This sum\nof \ufffd6,500,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the \nprincipal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward\nto claim it .According to British law, at the expiration of 7 years,\nthe money will revert to the ownership of the Bristish Government if\nnobody applies to claim the fund.\n\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner\nto stand as the next of kin to Mr. Andrea Schranner.\nThis is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full\nname and address so that an accredited Attorney working with the\nbank here will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which\nwill put you in place as the next of kin.We shall employ the service\nof two attorneys for the drafting and notarization of the will and\nobtain the necessary documents and letter of probate administration\nin your favour for the transfer into any bank account in any part of\nthe world which you will provide.We will then facilitate the\ntransfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.The\nmoney will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of \n50% for me and 30% for you and 10 % will be set aside to ofset any\nexpenses incured during the business , while the other 10% will go\nto charity organisation. There is no risk at all,the paperwork for\nthis transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as an\naccountant in the bank with the help of the branch Manager\nguarantees the successful execution of this transaction. Please\nreply immediately via the private email address below to show your\ninterest , upon your responses, I shall provide you with more\ndetails and relevant documents that will help you understand the\ntransaction.\n\nPlease observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that\nthis transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I\nshall require your assistance to invest my share of this money in\nyour country.\nPlease upon the receipt of this mail message, send to me the\nfollowing to enable me start the processing of the fund transfer\ninto your bank account:\n1.)
