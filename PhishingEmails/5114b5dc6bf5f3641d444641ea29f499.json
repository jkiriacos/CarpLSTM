I will give you \n30% of the total.Upon the receipt of your response, I will send you by fax\n or e-mail the application, bank's fax number and the next step to take.\nI  will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free\nand  that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer\n can be finalized with in five banking days, after you apply to the bank\nas  a relation to the deceased.When you receive this letter.
