Efforts had been \nmade by\nthe management of my bank through the Australian\nEmbassy to \ncontact any of the deceased children but to\nno avail.\n\nWe later \ndiscovered that he had no children.Given the\nskeletal information \navailable to the bank,it has so\nfar been impossible to reach any of the \nrelatives. The\nsituation left for the Management is to declare the\ndeceased account dormant and revert the funds to\ntrading for interest \nto the Bank. In order to avoid\nthis development, my Colleagues and I \nnow seek your\napproval to have you stand as a distant relative to\nEngr \nDonald Pepper,so that the money would be released\nto you.\n\nAll \ndocuments and proofs to enable you get the money\nwill be carefully \npackaged once we receive your\ninterest in this proposal.I shall apply \nfor a leave as\nsoon as the funds get into your reliable account to\ncome \nto your country for sharing and investments which\nyou will assist me in \ndoing.\n\nMay I assure you that this is safe and risk-free, as\nwe have \ntaken care of all necessary modalities to\nensure a hitch-free movement. \nI have the authority of\nmy partners involved in this assignment to \npropose\nthat should you be willing to assist us in this,your\nshare \nwould be 30%.\n\nI have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you\nwill not disappoint me. Call me immediately to show\nthat you have \nrecieved this mail and I will brief you\nmore on the successful transfer \nprocess.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nMR.JOHNSON GUBE.\nPHONE NUMBER:+229-95403548\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "86c64d82a04d0e0f6485ac3f3b0ba8ec"}
