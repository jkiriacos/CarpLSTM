Dollars (US$28,500,000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.\n\nThis amount (US$28.5m) represents the balance of the total contract value \nexecuted on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which \nwe the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost \nhave been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune \nof the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.\n\nI have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you \nbe willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% \nof the US$28.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous \nexpenses.
