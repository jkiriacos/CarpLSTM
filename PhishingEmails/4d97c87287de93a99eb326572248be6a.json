It is important to inform\nyou that as civil servants, we are forbidden to\noperate a foreign account; that is why we require your\nassistance. The total sum will be shared as follows:\n70% for us, 25% for you and 5% for local and\ninternational expenses incidental to the transfer. \n\nThe transfer is risk free on both sides. I am an\naccountant with the Department of Minerals and Energy \nCorporation (DME). If you find this proposal\nacceptable, we shall require the following documents: \n\n(a) Your bank name, telephone, your account details and fax\nnumbers. \n\n(b) Your private telephone and fax numbers - for\nconfidentiality and easy communication. \n\n(c) Your letter-headed paper stamped and signed. \n\nAlternatively we will furnish you with the text of\nwhat to type into your letter-headed paper, along with\na breakdown explaining, comprehensively what we\nrequire of you. \n\nPlease reply urgently through the below email address.\nEmail: mmorebe@zwallet.com\nTel + 27 83 511 9309 \n\nBest regards \nMr.M Morebe\n\n\n\n", "id": "4d97c87287de93a99eb326572248be6a"}
