A deceased\nclient of mine, by name Mr. Andrew Parker, who hereinafter\nshall be referred to as my client, died as a result of\na heart-related condition in November 2002. I have contacted\nyou to assist in repatriating the money left behind by my client\nbefore it is confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank\nwhere this deposit valued at 45 million dollars is lodged.\n\nThis bank has issued me a notice to contact the next of kin, or\nthe account will be confiscated because there is a government\ngazzette/mandate/authorising all banks to freeze or consificate\nany account that has not been servicable in a long period of time,\nthis is geared towards capital flight for the economy.\n\nMy proposition to you is to seek your consent to present you as\nthe next-of-kin and beneficiary of my named client, so that the\nproceeds of this account can be paid to you, then we can share\nthe amount on a mutually agreed-upon percentage. All legal documents\nto back up your claim as my client's next-of-kin will be provided.\n\nAll I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this\ntransaction through. This will be executed under a legitimate\narrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.\n\nIf this business proposition offends your moral values, do accept my\napology but if not, then contact me at once to indicate your interest,\nby giving me your telephone number, fax number and your address.\n\nKindly reply to: kevinwoodgate@4x.ro\nRegards,\n\nBarrister Kevin Woodgate.\n\n\n", "id": "9f5db105998253a2d1f39c6bf7d61833"}
