This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and establishment of a new farm in Swaziland a small country  near Zimbabwe here. \n\nThis land problem came when Zimbabwe President MR. ROBERT MUGABE introduced a New Land Act reform, which Wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few Black farmers.
