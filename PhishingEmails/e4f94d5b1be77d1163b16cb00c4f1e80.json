", "email_body": "\nFROM THE DESK OF DR YUSUF SAMI.\nBILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER\nFOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.\nBANK OF AFRICA(BOA)\nOUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO.\n\n\n\n\nDear friend ,\n\nI am the manager of bill and exchange at FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.BANK OF \nAFRICA(BOA)I am writing, following the impressive information about you \nthrough one of my friends who runs a consultancy firm in your country. He \nassured me of your capability and releability to champion this\nbusiness opportunity.\n\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of U.S$10m US dollars (Ten \nMillion US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign \ncustomer who died along with his entire family on Monday,31 July, 2000,in a \nplane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been \nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot \nrelease it unless\nsomebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as \nindicated in our banking guidlines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that \nall his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the \nplane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this\ndiscovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make \nthis business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of \nkin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since \nnobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the\nbank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidline here \nstipulates that if such money\nremained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the \nbank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreign as next of kin in \nthis business is occassioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner \nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\n\nWe agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in \nrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 5% will be set aside for \nexpenses incured during the business and 65% would be for me and my \ncolleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for \ndisbursement according to the percentages indicated.\n\nTherefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, \nyou must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased \nindicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone \nand fax number for easy and effective communication and location\nwherein the money will be remitted.\n\nUpon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail the text of \nthe application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this \ntransaction is risk-free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear \nas all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.\nYou should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter for \nmore explanations.\n\nYours faithfully,\nDR YUSUF SAMI.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nTestez Windows Live Mail Beta ! http://www.ideas.live.com/\n\n\n\n", "id": "e4f94d5b1be77d1163b16cb00c4f1e80"}
