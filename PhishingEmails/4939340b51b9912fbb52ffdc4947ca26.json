And the banking ethics here\ndoes not allow such money to stay more than seven\nyears, because the money will be recalled to the bank\ntreasury as unclaimed after this period. In view of\nthis I got your contact through my search via business\nreport from your web site to see if you can assist. I\nwill give you 25% of the total.\n\nUpon the receipt of your response, I will send to you\nby fax or e-mail the application letter, bank's fax\nnumber and the next step to take. I will not fail to\nbring to your notice that this business is hitch free\nand that you should not entertain any fear as all\nmodalities for fund transfer can be finalized within\nfive banking days, after you apply to the bank as a\nrelation to the deceased.\nWhen you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail\nsignifying Your decision including your private\nTel/Fax numbers for quick communication.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMusa A Zulu.\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "4939340b51b9912fbb52ffdc4947ca26"}
