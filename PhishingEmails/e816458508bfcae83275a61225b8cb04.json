I will first introduce \nmyself as Mr.Don Kelly, a staff in the Private Clients Section of a \nwell-known bank, here in London, England.\n\nOne of our accounts, with \nholding balance of \u00a315,000,000 (Fifteen Million Pounds Sterling) has \nbeen dormant and last operated three years ago. From my investigations \nand confirmation, the owner of the said account, a foreigner by name \nJohn Shumejda died on the 4th of January 2002 in a plane crash in \nBirmingham; you can view this CNN website \n\nhttp://edition.cnn.\ncom/2002/WORLD/europe/01/04/england.plane/ for details on the crash. \n\nSince then, nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this \nmoney, as he has no family member that has any knowledge as to the \nexistence of either the account or the funds; and also Information from \nthe National Immigration also states that he was single on entry into \nthe UK.\n\nI have confidently discussed this issue with the bank manager \nand we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal \nwith. We \ntherefore propose to do business with you, standing in as the next of \nkin of these funds from the deceased and funds released to you after \nnecessary processes have been followed.\n\nThis transaction is totally \nfree of risk and troubles as the fund is legitimate and does not \noriginate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other illegal act.\n\nOn your interest, let me hear from you URGENTLY. \n\nBest Regards,\n\nMr.\nDon Kelly.\n\n\n\n", "id": "e816458508bfcae83275a61225b8cb04"}
