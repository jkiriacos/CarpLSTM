I am writing following an opportunity in my office that will be of immense benefit to both of us.\nIn my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 26.5million British Pounds Sterling (Twenty-Six Million Five Hundred Thousand British Pounds) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and only daughter. \n\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. \n\nUnfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to make business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed bill.\n\nThe banking law and guidelines here stipulates that such money remained after five years the money will be transferred into banking\ntreasury as unclaimed funds.\n\nWe agreed that 35% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, while the balance will be for me and my colleagues. I will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account. Please be honest to me and trust is our watchword in this transaction.\nNote this transaction is confidential and risk free. As soon as you receive this mail you should contact me by return mail. Please note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to you has been finalised. We will discuss much in details when I do receive your response.\nDo call me and lets discuss more on this. \n\nBest regards\nFehmi Mehmet\n\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\nMail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site\n- http://politiks.us\n\n\n", "id": "c27fad96232d52b29c67e561a7e387a8"}
