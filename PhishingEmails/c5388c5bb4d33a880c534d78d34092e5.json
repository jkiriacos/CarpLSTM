The contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign contractors to the tune of US$100,000,000.00 (One hundred  Million United States Dollars). But in the course of negotiation, the contract was awarded to a Bulgarian contractor at the cost of US$115,500,000.00 (One hundred and Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) to my benefit unknown to the contractor.
