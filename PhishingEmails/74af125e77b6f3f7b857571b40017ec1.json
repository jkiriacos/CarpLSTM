However, I have already sent you this same letter \nby post one month ago, but I am not sure if it did get to you since I \nhave not heard from you, hence my resending it again. \n   I discovered \na dormant account in my office, as Group finance director with Halifax \nBank of Scotland. It will be in my interest to transfer this fund worth \n15,000,000 million pounds in an account offshore. If you can be a \ncollaborator to this please indicate interest immediately for us to \nproceed. Your contact phone numbers  will be necessary for this \neffect. \nRegards and respect,\nDr. Phil Hodkinson\nGroup Finance Director\nHalifax Bank of Scotland\n\n\n", "id": "74af125e77b6f3f7b857571b40017ec1"}
