The original value of these contracts were delibrately over invoiced to the sum of USD$17,000,000.00 (seventeen million united state dollars).This amount has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned. \r\nConsequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil service law) from operating and/or opening foreign accounts in our names. \r\nNeedless to say, the trust reposed on you at this is enormous, in return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) between both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts in due course.\r\n\r\nModalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of finance and the Central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our assurance is that your role is risk free. To accord this transaction  the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the funds the whole approval procedures will officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any company you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary.\r\n\r\nOnce more I want you to understand that having put in over twenty five years in the civil service of my country, I am averse to having my image and career dented. \r\nThis matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves. Please you should signify your intention to assist by  you sending me a mail through my confidential email address so that I can brief you further (abu_saeed4@tiscali.co.uk).\r\n\r\nI want to assure you that this business proposal is 100% risk free as we have done our home work properly. I quite believe that you will protect our interest by taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are still in government service,which we intend to retire from.  \r\nkindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the first batch which would constitute the first quarter payments for the 2003 financial year.\r\n\r\nThanks and God bless.\r\nEngr: Abubakar Saeed.", "id": "abd302040158a33d9c723563393ef739"}
