I came to know of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle this confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign country.\n\nTHE PREPOSITION\nThe late  JERRY ADAMS a Foreigner and an oil merchant / contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria until his death four years ago in a plane crash, banked with us  and had a closing balance of USD10,000,000.00 (Ten Million United States Dollars).\n\nThe bank now unquestionably expect it to be claimed by JERRY ADAMS next of kin. Efforts have been made by my bank to get in touch with any of the ADAMS Family but to no avail. It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate JERRY ADAMS next of kin (NOK) that the management under the influence of our Executive Director has agreed that since the incident occurred in 1997 and has left the fund dormant and devalued, we should transfer the fund overseas and utilize it either on stock exchange market or personal business interest.\n\nYour role is very important as the fund when concluded on transfer would be justifiably presented as having been remitted to JERRY ADAMS next of kin (NOK)  . Your interest will be protected as unnecessary documentation will be avoided. Note that all modalities necessary for execution of the business have been perfected. \n\nThe money will be shared equally i.e 50% for you 50% for us, expenses too will be shared equally .\n\nIt is a risk-free deal. \n\nMr Temi Efosa\nMail to : tefosa2@37.com \n\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nJoin Excite! - http://www.excite.com\nThe most personalized portal on the Web!\n\n", "id": "ae8a2af587073e560dd5b14584c9500b"}
