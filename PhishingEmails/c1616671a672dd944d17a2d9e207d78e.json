My Doctor told me that I would not last\nfor the\nnext three months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most\nis my partial stroke as a result of high blood pressure.\n\nHaving known my condition I decided to donate this funds to church or\nbetter still a Christian individual that will utilize this money the\nway\nI am going to instruct herein. I want a church or individual that will\nuse this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the\nword of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.\n\nThe Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that grivet. I\ntook this decision because I dont have any child that will\ninherit\nthis money and my husband's relatives are not Christians and I\ndont\nwant my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I\ndont want a situation where this money will be used in an\nungodly\nmanner, hence the reason for taking this bold decision.\n\nI am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going.
