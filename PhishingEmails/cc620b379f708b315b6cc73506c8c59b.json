{"email_subject": "REPLY URGENTLY.", "email_body": "FROM: MR ALIU SALAMI.\nAFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ANNEX)\nBILL AND EXCHANGE DEPARTMENT,\nOFFSHORE OFFICE,OUAGADOUGOU,BURKINA-FASO.\n\nDear,\n\nI know that this letter may come to you as a\nsurprise, I got your contact address from the\ncomputerized search when I was searching for a\nbusiness partner. My name is Mr Aliu Salami, I am the\nBill and Exchange (assistant) Manager of African\nDevelopment Bank Ouagadouguo, Burkina Faso.\n\nIn my department I discovered an abandoned sum of\neighteen million three hundred thousand United State\nof American dollars ($18.3MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS) in an\naccount that belongs to one of our foreign customer Mr\nHazim Ibrahim from Alexandra Eygpt who died along with\nhis family in Siber airline that crashed into sea at\nIsreal on 4th October 2001.\n\nSince I got information about his death I have been\nexpecting his next of kin to come over and claim his\nmoney because we cannot release it unless somebody\napplies for it as the next of kin or relation to the\ndeceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but\nunfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of\nkin or relation died alongside with him in the plane\ncrash leaving nobody behind for the claim.\n\nIt is therefore upon this discovery that I decided\nto make this business proposal to you and release the\nmoney to you as next of kin or relation to the\ndeceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since\nnobody is coming for it because I don't want the money\nto go into the bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The\nbanking laws and guidelines here stipulates that if\nsuch money remains unclaimed after five years the\nmoney will be transfered into the bank treasury as\nunclaimed fund.\n\nThe request of foreigner in this transaction is\nnecessary because our late customer was a foreigner\nand a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a\nforeigner. I have agreed that 33% of this money will\nbe for you as foreigner partner in respect to the\nprovision of a foreign account, 2% will be set aside\nfor expenses that might occurred during the business\nand 65% would be for me, after which I shall visit\nyour country for disbursement according to the\npercentages indicated.\n\nTherefore to enable the immediate transfer of this\nfund to you as we arranged you will furnished me with\na good receiving account details where the money will\nbe transfered, your private telephone and fax number\nfor easy communication.\n\nUpon receipt of your reply I will send to you by fax\nor e-mail a text of the application which you shall\nretype and fax to our foreign remittance manager for\neasy execution of the transaction.\n\nI will not fail to bring to your notice that this\ntransaction is 100% hitch-free on both side as all\nrequired arrangement has been made for the transfer.\nPlease I would like you to keep this transaction\nconfidential and as a top secret as you may wish to\nknow that I am a Bank official.\n\nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\n\nYours Sincerely,\nMr Aliu Salami.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nDcouvrez Windows Live Messenger : le futur de MSN Messenger ! \nwww.windowslivemessenger.fr\n\n\n\n", "id": "cc620b379f708b315b6cc73506c8c59b"}
