I am (jerry kabore\\xa0Esq),The Head of file Department in African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist search.When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God or   Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it   and we don’t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private   telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer. You should contact me on my number 00226-7885 75 97, immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. Your’s faithfully,\\xa0jerry kabore\\xa0(Esq.)POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As you finished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well over this business.'\n",

      " 'Greeting from Dubai.. Greetings from Dubai,\\n \\nThis letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners.  I am Mr. Ali Raza Khan, currently Head of Coporate affairs with a reputable bank here in U. A. E.  I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you.\\n \\nI have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On November 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign  Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION, MR. jack farrer powell  made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months, valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my \\nbank and I happen to be his account officer before I was moved to my present position recently. Upon maturity in 2003,as his account officer and as well the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was returned undelivered. \\n \\nAfter sometime, I tried sending back the letter,but it was again returned and finally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr.jack farrer powell  died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his country Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. On further investigation, I discovered that Mr. jack farrer powell  family wife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his \\nofficial documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any WILL.This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have heard from the owner since 2003.I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have made so far, my bank \\nmanagement is not aware of it, I am the only one that have the information.\\n \\nWith the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E.  By end of this year, the government will pass a new financial control law which will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of above $5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it is not for terrorism support.  If I do not move this money out of the country immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source of the money.  \\n \\nI cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance.  As the Account Officer to late jack farrer powell , coupled with my present position and status in the bank as Head of Retail Banking Groug , I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you.  All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that \\nwill protect you from any breach of law, beside U. A. E is porous and anything goes.\\n \\nIf you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message  so we can go over the details.  \\nThanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality . I shall send you copy of his last statement of account issued to Al Nasser when the deposit was made for your perusal.  I wait your urgent response soon. \\n  \\n \\nRegards,     \\nMr. Ali Raza Khan.'\n",

I came across your\\ncontact via a missionary that visited our asylum Camp,\\nbut I did not disclose the nature of this transaction\\nto her because of the secrecy involved.\\n\\nAccordingly, I will like to inform you that this is\\nnote a bragging because it will look too cheap and\\nsurprised to you from the way I have contacting you to\\nassist me in making this transaction a success.  \\n\\nDue to the war raged in our Republic, the late\\nPresident, Laurent Kabila was using me, through\\ndiplomatic means, to send money out of the Republic\\nbecause of the fear that a coup de tat may take place\\nat any time.\\n\\nI did this on two consecutive occasions, on the third\\ntrip, myself and some aides decided to divert the\\ndelivery, which amounted to US$30Million (Thirty\\nMillion United states Dollars).\\n\\nI am presently in exile, because of exactly what\\nhappened to my late cousin, former President Laurent\\nDesire Kabila, May his soul rest in peace.\\n\\nI have since deposited the money into a Security\\nCompany in one of the European Country that will be\\ndisclosed to you upon your acceptance to assist me,\\nbut the real content of the deposited box containing\\nthis fund was not disclosed to them for Security\\nreason.\\n\\nDue to shortcomings and restrictions prevailing in\\nhere regarding refugee policy, I came up with the idea\\nof foreign investment for the fund, with the\\npossibility of a joint stock venture with a foreign\\npartner, outside the continent of Africa.\\n\\nMy main aim and objective of contacting you is to ask\\nfor your assistance in retrieve the said fund from the\\nprivate firm where it was deposited and transfer it\\ninto your private or company&#8217;s account in your\\ncountry.\\n\\nThere is no risk involved, as this is confidential. I\\nhave decided to let you have 25% of the total amount\\nof the fund, 5% is for expenses that will be incurred\\nduring the transaction, and the remaining 70% of the\\nfund is for myself, which I would like to invest in\\nyour country.\\n\\nIf you can be trusted and interested, please contact\\nme on the below e-mail as soon as\\npossible:private_danladi@yahoo.com.au\\n\\nOn the receipt of your acceptance mail, I shall give\\nyou more clarification on the modalities needed for\\nthe successful completion of this transaction.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nPrince Danladi A.

This account was open with the bank in 1993 and since 1998 nobody has operated it. After careful investigation, I discovered that the owner of this account was the president of   MIRA CONSTRUCTION COMPANY LTD. Despite several attempts by the bank to trace the relatives/next of kin of the deceased, up to date nobody has yet come forward to claim the money.\\n\\nI later discovered that all his supposed next of kin died with him in the auto crash incident. I have spent the last five years monitoring the account and gathering necessary information and documents on it. Now that all papers are ready, I am asking for your assistant to release the money to you as next of kin or relation to the deceased for safekeeping and subsequent sharing.  The banking laws of Nigeria stipulates that such money, if unclaimed after five years of maturity, will be transferred into the Central Bank treasury as unclaimed effect. \\n\\nThe request for a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and presenting a Nigerian as the next of kin to a foreigner could raise concerns from the bank management. \\n\\nI am ready to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. 10% will be used to pay off all the necessary fees/charges involved in the transfer. 25% will go to two other officials of Eagle Bank that are with me in this and whose positions will greatly help in expediting the transfer. I will be taking 45%. Please note that these figures are negotiable. After the money has been transferred to your country, I will visit your country for the disbursement/investing of my share according to the percentages we agree upon. Note this transaction requires utmost confidentiality and I am assuring you that it is 100% risk-free so you need not be afraid. I will not contact any other person until I am convinced that you are not interested. \\n\\nCan you please send me your phone and fax number for safer communication when needed.

FROM THE DESK OF PETER OKOYE\\nSTANDARD TRUST BANK PLC\\nTel: 234-1-7760497  \\nFax: 234-1-7599947\\nPrivate Email:peteoko@gawab.com\\nI hope this letter will not embarrass you since we have not had any previous communication. I got your reference from your country`s trade department under private enquiry that is not related to my aim of writing you this letter and went further to have it confirmed by the Nigeria Exports Promotion Council(NEPC). \\nI am Mr. Peter Okoye, a Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank Plc, Lagos Balogun Branch.  I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, an American Oil Consultant/Contractor with the National Oil Nigeria Ltd. Mr. Robert Noel made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months. Valued at US$48,000,000.00 (Forty-Eight Million United States Dollars only) in my branch upon maturity.\\nI sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the National Oil Nigeria LTD that Mr. Robert Noel died on air crash in ADC Airline going to Abuja our Federal Capital Territory. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making �WILL�, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.\\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Robert Noel did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$48,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigeria Law, at the expiration of 5 (Five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to act as the next kin to Mr. Robert Noel so that the fruits of this old man�s labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials here.\\nThis transaction is very simple and 100% risk free, therefore I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that an Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the �WILL� and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate and realization in your favour for the transfer.\\nA Bank Account in any part of the world, which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your Account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and 10% will be for expences both parties might have incured during the process of transfering the money.Try and call me on my private number immediately you recieve this email on 234-1-7760497 or write me back on my private email address(peteoko@gawab.com) for further explanations.\\nI look forward to your earlist response to my proposal.\\nYours Truly.\\nMr Peter Okoye\\nBranch Manager.'\n",

Since\\nhis death , I personally has watched with keen\\ninterest to see the next of kin but all has proved\\nabortive as no one has come to claim his funds and no\\nother person knows about this account or anything\\nconcerning it,the account has no other beneficiary and\\nuntil his death he was the manager of his company.\\n\\nThe total amount involved is 106,000,000.00 USD.[ One\\nhundred and six million United States Dollar ].

In view\\nof this I got your contact through my personal search\\nto see if you can assist by providing your safe bank\\naccount for the transfer or find a reliable person who\\nwill be capable of receiving such amount in his or her\\npersonal account.\\n\\nAt the conclussion of the transfer 65% of the fund\\nwill be for me, I will give you 20% of the total\\ntransfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and in\\nyour country while the remaining 5% will be set aside\\nto settle expenses both parties might incure during\\nthe transfer process.\\n\\nUpon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you a\\ndetailed information about the transaction.I will not\\nfail to bring to your notice that this business is\\n100% risk and trouble free and that you should not\\nentertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer\\ncan be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days, after you\\napply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from\\nthe deceased. When you receive this letter.\\n\\nKindly send me an e-mail MY PRIVATE EMAIL ADDRESS~:\\nauditorotto2@netscape.net  You should also include\\nyour private fax and phone numbers for easy and safe\\ncommunication.\\n\\nRespectfully yours,\\nDr.RICHARD SHUBANE\\n\\n\\n\\n__________________________________\\nDo you Yahoo!?\\nYahoo!

Since then, my husband and I have been living in exile in Dakar - Senegal. My husband died last August as a result of cardiac arrest. \\n   \\n  A substential amount of money was deposited in the finance house by my husband before his death through the help of the International Red Cross staff, because President Mugabe, placed order for the closure of the accounts of all the white farmers and no one is allowed to transfer more than ten thousand dollars abroad but luckily enough, I and my late husband along with some other farmers were assisted through diplomatic means with the help of the International Red Cross to send our money abroad.\\n\\nThe total Sum is FIFTEEN million US dollars (US$15.000.000.), \\nthe money is part of our savings and what my husband inherited from his late father, from whom we took over the family business.

    "📤 **Uploading to Colab from Your System? Here's How:**\n",
    "1. Go to [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n",
    "2. Hit \"upload\" on the left sidebar of the pop-up box.\n",
    "3. Upload the notebook.\n",
    "4. It's alright if you've already run your code, the outputs of the cells should be brought over too.\n",

    "🛣️ **Once you're on colab (or if you always were):**\n",
    "1. First things first, click on File > Locate in Drive.\n",
    "2. Next up, copy the path of the folder where your notebook resides in your Drive and paste it in variable named `DIR_FOR_COLAB_NOTEBOOK` in the cell below. (Usually, it's just 'Colab Notebooks/')\n",
    "3. Next asisgn the variable named `NOTEBOOK_NAME` with the name of your notebook. Easy peasy!\n",
