I am (jerry kabore\\xa0Esq),The Head of file Department in African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist search.When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God or   Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it   and we don’t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private   telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer. You should contact me on my number 00226-7885 75 97, immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. Your’s faithfully,\\xa0jerry kabore\\xa0(Esq.)POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As you finished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well over this business.'\n",

      " 'Greeting from Dubai.. Greetings from Dubai,\\n \\nThis letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners.  I am Mr. Ali Raza Khan, currently Head of Coporate affairs with a reputable bank here in U. A. E.  I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you.\\n \\nI have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On November 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign  Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION, MR. jack farrer powell  made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 calendar months, valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my \\nbank and I happen to be his account officer before I was moved to my present position recently. Upon maturity in 2003,as his account officer and as well the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was returned undelivered. \\n \\nAfter sometime, I tried sending back the letter,but it was again returned and finally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr.jack farrer powell  died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his country Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. On further investigation, I discovered that Mr. jack farrer powell  family wife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his \\nofficial documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any WILL.This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have heard from the owner since 2003.I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have made so far, my bank \\nmanagement is not aware of it, I am the only one that have the information.\\n \\nWith the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E.  By end of this year, the government will pass a new financial control law which will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of above $5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it is not for terrorism support.  If I do not move this money out of the country immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source of the money.  \\n \\nI cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance.  As the Account Officer to late jack farrer powell , coupled with my present position and status in the bank as Head of Retail Banking Groug , I have the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you.  All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that \\nwill protect you from any breach of law, beside U. A. E is porous and anything goes.\\n \\nIf you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message  so we can go over the details.  \\nThanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality . I shall send you copy of his last statement of account issued to Al Nasser when the deposit was made for your perusal.  I wait your urgent response soon. \\n  \\n \\nRegards,     \\nMr. Ali Raza Khan.'\n",

I came across your\\ncontact via a missionary that visited our asylum Camp,\\nbut I did not disclose the nature of this transaction\\nto her because of the secrecy involved.\\n\\nAccordingly, I will like to inform you that this is\\nnote a bragging because it will look too cheap and\\nsurprised to you from the way I have contacting you to\\nassist me in making this transaction a success.  \\n\\nDue to the war raged in our Republic, the late\\nPresident, Laurent Kabila was using me, through\\ndiplomatic means, to send money out of the Republic\\nbecause of the fear that a coup de tat may take place\\nat any time.\\n\\nI did this on two consecutive occasions, on the third\\ntrip, myself and some aides decided to divert the\\ndelivery, which amounted to US$30Million (Thirty\\nMillion United states Dollars).\\n\\nI am presently in exile, because of exactly what\\nhappened to my late cousin, former President Laurent\\nDesire Kabila, May his soul rest in peace.\\n\\nI have since deposited the money into a Security\\nCompany in one of the European Country that will be\\ndisclosed to you upon your acceptance to assist me,\\nbut the real content of the deposited box containing\\nthis fund was not disclosed to them for Security\\nreason.\\n\\nDue to shortcomings and restrictions prevailing in\\nhere regarding refugee policy, I came up with the idea\\nof foreign investment for the fund, with the\\npossibility of a joint stock venture with a foreign\\npartner, outside the continent of Africa.\\n\\nMy main aim and objective of contacting you is to ask\\nfor your assistance in retrieve the said fund from the\\nprivate firm where it was deposited and transfer it\\ninto your private or company&#8217;s account in your\\ncountry.\\n\\nThere is no risk involved, as this is confidential. I\\nhave decided to let you have 25% of the total amount\\nof the fund, 5% is for expenses that will be incurred\\nduring the transaction, and the remaining 70% of the\\nfund is for myself, which I would like to invest in\\nyour country.\\n\\nIf you can be trusted and interested, please contact\\nme on the below e-mail as soon as\\npossible:private_danladi@yahoo.com.au\\n\\nOn the receipt of your acceptance mail, I shall give\\nyou more clarification on the modalities needed for\\nthe successful completion of this transaction.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nPrince Danladi A.

I am the surviving Daughter of  Dr. and Mrs Hatleberg who died as a result of plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000. My family converted to Islam in 1998. When my late Parent were alive, my father deposited the sum of$8.5 Million (eight million five hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) with International Diplomatic service firm in south east Asia with purpose to invest the fund in Islamic foundation in Asia before death took him, The fund is still under safe keeping with the International Diplomatic firm in south east Asia, hence am contacting you to help me to achieve this project in your country. Two years ago I fell sick and my doctor told me I had cancer, I had tried all my best to treat myself with every medical expert but there is no improvement, Currently my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next six months due to my cancer problems. Having known my condition, I decided to donate this fund to mosque, Islamic school authority or better Muslim individual that will utilize this money the way I instruct. I want this fund to be disburse to, orphanages, widows promoting the work of Almighty Allah, needies and to promote work of almighty Allah in your country. The Koran made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have anybody left except Almighty Allah and my Father relatives are Christians and unbelievers. I don't want my Father hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers because I know he will be rejoicing in the bosom of Allah if this fund is spent to promote the work of almighty Allah. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. That's the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the heaven. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because my health. With Allah all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I will instruct the DIPLOMATIC operation manager and my Father lawyer in London to furnish you with more details on how to receive this fund. I will also instruct him to issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original-beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the Moslem to always pray for me because in almighty Allah I put my hope. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Moslem. Whosever that wants to serve Allah must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. And reply me through my e- mail address as delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for another faith member for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated here. As I am disabled and can not be able to move around and do much due to am presently very ill, I will really appreciate your urgent respond through my Email address as the internet is my only mean of communicating. Or through the help of a nurse here who is so kind to assist me in the hospital and taking care of me You can read more about this crash by visiting this website,  and  Remain blessed in the name of the Allah.

PETER WANG QIN\\n\\nSTANDARD BANK SA\\n\\nE-MAIL: pet_wang@standardbanksa.net\\nDear Sir,\\n\\n\\n                                   HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL\\n\\nGreetings.\\n\\nThis mail may come to you as a surprise but I plead with you to patiently\\nread through it before making a decision whether to assist me or not.\\n\\nI wish to solicit for your assistance in the transaction which I strongly\\nbelieves will be of mutual benefit to both of us if treated with trust and\\nconfidentiality that it deserve.\\n\\nMy name is Mr. Peter Wang Qin, the branch manager of a reputable bank\\nin Johannesburg, Gauteng Province, in the Republic of South Africa. I and\\ntwo of my colleagues wish to seek your assistance in the transfer of some\\nhuge sum of money into a foreign bank account.\\n\\nThis money was deposited seven years ago in a fixed deposit account in my\\nbank by an Oil consultant/contractor with the South African Mining\\nCorporation. (Name deliberately withheld for now) The length of time for the\\nmaturity of the fixed deposit was five years, which expired towards the\\nending of last year. Upon maturity, a routine notification was sent to his\\nforwarding address but got no reply.\\n\\nAfter a month, a reminder was also sent and finally we discovered from his\\nContract Employers - The South African Mining Corporation that the Depositor\\ndied from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that\\nthe depositor/beneficiary actually died in a car Accident here in South\\nAfrica, in May 2000 and he left nobody as next-of-kin to claim this money.\\nAll efforts made to trace any known relations of his proved abortive, and no\\none has written our bank in this regard.\\n\\nHence, this said money is still lying in my Bank and the interest is being\\nrolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. Now its clear\\nno one will ever come forward to claim it. And according to the Laws of\\nRepublic of South Africa, at the expiration of 5(five) Years, the money will\\nrevert to the ownership of The South African Government if nobody applies to\\nclaim the fund.\\n\\nAll modalities for the successful transfer of this money into an offshore\\nbank account have been put in place and we are looking for a trust worthy\\nforeign partner into whose bank account this fund would be remitted to and\\nit is this regard that my colleagues have mandated me to provide a partner\\nwho will assist us. We have agreed to compensate you with 25% of the total\\namount if you should accept to assist us.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you are interested in giving us the required assistance, kindly reply\\nthis mail stating your Telephone/Fax numbers for further action. Because of\\nthe secrecy surrounding this transaction, l suggests that you contact me\\nonly through e-mail, until further notice.\\n\\nI am looking forward to a favorable reply from you soon. Feel free to ask\\nany question in this regard.\\n\\nI remain,\\n\\nYours Faithfully,\\nMr. Peter Wang Qin'\n",

You can catch more  of the story on this the fund (US$423M) in question was approved by the Government of Russia  for payment of various YUKOS OIL contractors/suppliers to prevent them  from loosing the money they invested in the numerous contracts they  executed for the above firm. The Government had already concluded plans to frozen all the accounts in my boss name (Mikhail  Khodorkovsky) both corporate and personal before I connived with the  Accountant General of YUKOS OIL (who is also my partner in this transaction)  to raise a memo stating that YUKOS OIL owe contractors the above amount  which was finally approved for payment after some deliberations.  Actually, we have paid all our contractors both local and foreign because  they agitated for their payment when they had that my boss was arrested.

      " \"honestly ok. Qin Wang\\nLloyds TSB Pacific Limited\\nHong Kong Branch Two Exchange\\nSquare Central, Hong Kong.\\n\\nAttention,\\n\\nThank you for giving me your time, it is of great importance for you to take\\ncare and understand every word which I have written down below; please be\\npatient and read the explanation in my email.\\n\\nI am a staff of Lloyds TSB Group Plc. here in Hong Kong attached in Private\\nBanking Services, I am contacting you concerning a customer and an investment\\nplaced under our banks management; as a matter of factit was 3 years ago. I\\nwould respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail private and\\nalso to kindly respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result\\nof this email. I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is\\ninformed of this communication; I would like to intimate you with certain facts\\nthat I believe would be of interest to you.\\n\\nIn 2001, the subject matter; Ref: FI/TSB/958/042/0500 came to our bank to engage\\nin business discussions with our Private Banking Services Department. He\\ninformed us that he had a financial portfolio of 15.37 million United States\\nDollars, which he wished to have us turn over (invest) on his behalf. I was the\\nofficer assigned to his case; I made numerous suggestions in line with my duties\\nas the de-facto chief operations officer of the Private Banking Services\\nepartment,especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank.\\nWe met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed, and however\\nI encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The\\nfavored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on 600\\ntraditional stocks and bond managers and 200 managers of alternative\\ninvestments. Based on my advice, we spun the money around various opportunities\\nand made attractive margins for our first months of operation,the accrued profit\\nwith interest included, stood at this point at over 16.2 million United States\\nDollars,this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low\\nrisk guaranteed returns on investments.In mid 2002, he asked that the money be\\nliquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash\\npayments in Europe. He directed that I liquidate the funds and had it deposited\\nwith a firm in Europe. I informed him that our bank would have to make special\\narrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the\\nbank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking\\nand statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around\\nwhen I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us.\\n\\nCash movement across borders has become especially strict since the incidents of\\n9/11. I contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in mainland\\nEurope, I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise\\ninstructions to the letter and had the funds deposited in a security\\nconsultancy firm, the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts deposits\\nfrom high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable\\nproducts or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash. This\\nsmall and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly\\nplaced and well-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money\\nwas deposited; he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his\\narrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had,\\nthis transpired aroundbFebruary 25th 2003. In June last year, we got a call\\nfrom the security firm informing us of the inactivity of that particular\\nportfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the\\nfact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who knew about\\nthe deposit, and I could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his\\ndeposit.\\n\\nI made futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of locating\\nhim to the internal investigations department of our bank. Four days later,\\ninformation started to trickle in, that he was apparently dead, a person who\\nsuited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Cannes, South of\\nFrance; we were soon enough able to gather more information and the cause of\\ndeath was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into\\npossible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come\\nforward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs,\\nthose who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels\\nof detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no\\nnext of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us means\\nno one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name;\\ndepositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also\\ngives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the\\nbank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said,\\nrarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not\\nnominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in\\nthis case; he died Intestate.\\n\\nIn line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we\\ninstituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have\\nright to claim the estate, this investigation for several months were futile.\\nWe have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate\\ncompanies to get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that\\nresulted in my decision to obtain your contact details and contact you, being\\nas a foreigner or rather non-Asian, as a potential benefactor of the estate\\neven if you are in no way affiliated with this individual (the deceased).My\\nofficial capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the\\ninvestigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation.\\nWhat this means, with you being a foreigner, I have considered the fact that\\nour dear late fellow died with no known or identifiable family member. This\\nleaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing\\nsituation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the\\ndeposit. According to practice, the firm shall by the end of this financial\\nyear broadcast a request for statements of claim to our bank, failing to\\nreceive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit back to our\\nbank.This will result in the money entering our bank's accounting system and\\nthe portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the Private Banking Services\\nDepartment. This will not happen if I have my way.\\n\\n\\nWhat I wish to relate to you might be a smack of unethical practice but I want\\nyou to understand something; it is only an outsider to the banking world who\\nfinds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of\\nprivate banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy\\ncertain offices and oversee certain portfolios; you should have begun by now to\\nput together the general direction of what I propose. There is USD$\\n15,991,674(Thirteen million, nine hundred and ninety one thousand, six hundred\\nand seventy four united states dollars) deposited, I alone have the deposit\\ndetails and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do\\nso.\\n\\nI alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as the finance firm is\\nconcerned, the transaction with our deceased customer concluded when I sent the\\nfunds to the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are just\\ncustomer services and due process. The finance firm has no single idea of what's\\nthe history or nature of the deposit, they are simply awaiting instructions to\\nrelease the deposit to any party that comes forward, and this is the situation.\\nThis bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track the family of the\\ndeceased; they have investigated for months and have found no family but\\nhowever the investigation has officially come to an end.\\n\\nMy proposal; I am prepared to place you in a position whereby an instruction is\\ngiven to the finance firm to officially release the deposit to you as the\\nclosest surviving relation/associate, and all etiquette shall be done in\\naccordance with the rule of law, I certainly can guarantee you that. By the\\ncommon law,the power of bequeathing is coeval with the first rudiments of the\\nlaw, and this power has been extended to all a man's Personal and Real estate\\n(Personalty & Realty). There is no ruling which prevents an inheritance from\\nbeing so exhausted by legacies as to render it unworthy of the heir's\\nacceptance; basically all persons of sound mind are competent to bequeath and\\ndevise real and personal estate, excepting infants, with all this I would say\\nwe have the clear advantage to carry out a smooth and perfect operation whereby\\nthe paper work shall be coordinated in such a way that your status as a sole\\nbeneficiary is confirmed. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share\\nthe money with you in half and no more; that is: I will simply nominate you as\\nthe next of kin and have them release the deposit to you; afterwards we share\\nthe proceeds 50/50.\\n\\nI would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have\\ndrawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit, but on\\nthe other hand, you as a indifferent foreigner would easily pass as the\\nbeneficiary with the rights to claim, I assure you that I could have the\\ndeposit released to you in a few days. I will simply inform our bank of the\\nfinal closing of the file relating to the customer, I will then officially\\ncommunicate with the finance company and instruct them to release the deposit\\nto you; with these two things: all is done.The alternative would be for us to\\nhave the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder, this\\nway there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money from the firm.\\nWe can fine-tune this based on our interactions, I am aware of the consequences\\nof this proposal and I ask that if you find no interest in this project that\\nyou should discard this mail. I ask also, that you do not be vindictive or\\ndestructive, if my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget\\nI ever contacted you; please not destroy my career because you do not approve of\\nmy proposal. You may not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums\\nout of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector, I am not a\\ncriminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard\\nfor you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this\\nmove. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let\\nthis chance pass me by and I hope you understand,because for once I found\\nmyself in total control and face to face with my destiny. These chances won't\\npass me by, I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with\\nme please let me know, and hence move on with my life, but do not destroy me; I\\nam a family man and this is an occasion to provide them with new opportunities.\\nThere is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking, I\\nhave evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to\\nwork with me and alerting my bank; I am the only one who knows of this\\nsituation,good fortune will bless you and plant you into the center of\\nrelevance in my life, let?s share the blessing.\\n\\nIf you find yourself interested to work with me,please contact me specifically,\\nthrough this email account mrqinwang1954@netscap.net if you give me positive\\nsignals, I will initiate this process towards a quick conclusion.It is\\nnecessary to inform you that under no condition should you contact me via\\nofficial channels; I will simply deny knowing you and about this project. I\\nrepeat, I do not want you contacting me through our official lines neither do I\\nwant you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only\\nthrough this email address above; I do not want any direct link between you and\\nme. My official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to\\nassess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management\\npolicy, please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a\\nfamily man; I happily married with kids, I send you this mail not without a\\nmeasure of fear as to what the consequences might be, but I know within me that\\nnothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy\\nor on a platter of gold,this is the one truth I have learned from my private\\nbanking clients; do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord I\\nshall have the pleasure of meeting you, after this task has been completed we\\ncan plan a meeting.\\n\\nI await your response.\\n\\nYours Sincerely,\\n\\nQin Wang\"\n",

    "📤 **Uploading to Colab from Your System? Here's How:**\n",
    "1. Go to [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n",
    "2. Hit \"upload\" on the left sidebar of the pop-up box.\n",
    "3. Upload the notebook.\n",
    "4. It's alright if you've already run your code, the outputs of the cells should be brought over too.\n",

    "🛣️ **Once you're on colab (or if you always were):**\n",
    "1. First things first, click on File > Locate in Drive.\n",
    "2. Next up, copy the path of the folder where your notebook resides in your Drive and paste it in variable named `DIR_FOR_COLAB_NOTEBOOK` in the cell below. (Usually, it's just 'Colab Notebooks/')\n",
    "3. Next asisgn the variable named `NOTEBOOK_NAME` with the name of your notebook. Easy peasy!\n",
